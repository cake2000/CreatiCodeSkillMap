## 🎯 MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Skills Broken Down (3 → 8 sub-skills)

#### T32.G4.05 → 3 sub-skills
**Before:** "Recognize security indicators in apps and websites" (too broad)

**After:**
- **T32.G4.05.01:** Recognize secure connection indicators (HTTPS, padlock)
- **T32.G4.05.02:** Recognize verified badges and authentic accounts
- **T32.G4.05.03:** Understand app permission requests and warnings

**Why:** Each addresses distinct security concepts requiring separate assessment

#### T32.G5.01 → 2 skills
**Before:** "Analyze digital social engineering tactics" (covered 3 tactics)

**After:**
- **T32.G5.01:** Analyze phishing and email-based social engineering
- **T32.G5.02:** Analyze pretexting and phone-based social engineering

**Why:** Different psychological tactics requiring different defensive strategies

#### T32.G6.03 → 2 sub-skills
**Before:** "Understand network attacks (DoS, MitM)" (two unrelated attacks)

**After:**
- **T32.G6.03.01:** Understand denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
- **T32.G6.03.02:** Understand man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks

**Why:** DoS affects availability; MitM affects confidentiality - different mental models needed
