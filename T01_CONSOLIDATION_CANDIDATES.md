## Kindergarten (GK) - Potential Consolidations

### Group 1: Basic Sequencing
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.GK.01**: Put pictures in order for getting ready for bed (3 items)
- **T01.GK.02**: Put pictures in order for coming to class (4 items)

**Analysis**: Both teach picture sequencing. Main difference is context (bed vs class) and number of items (3 vs 4).

**Recommendation**: These are appropriately distinct. The progression from 3 to 4 items is pedagogically sound.

### Group 2: Pattern Recognition
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.GK.07**: Find the pattern that repeats
- **T01.GK.08**: Simple pattern game

**Analysis**: T01.GK.08 seems like a practice activity for T01.GK.07.

**Recommendation**: Consider consolidating or making T01.GK.08 an implementation note rather than a separate skill.

## Grade 1 (G1) - Potential Consolidations

### Group 1: Algorithmic Equivalence
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G1.07**: Decide if two algorithms finish with the same result
- **T01.G1.08**: Choose the shorter algorithm

**Analysis**: T01.G1.08 depends on T01.G1.07. They're closely related - checking equivalence, then choosing based on length.

**Recommendation**: Could be consolidated into one skill with two parts, OR keep separate as the progression is sound (first recognize equivalence, then optimize).

---

## Grade 2 (G2) - Potential Consolidations

### Group 1: If/Then Recognition
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G1.10**: Match pictures to "if/then" rules (G1)

### Group 2: Repeat Usage
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G2.02**: Use "repeat" to make directions shorter
- **T01.G2.03**: Write directions using "repeat"

### Group 3: If/Then Progressions
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G2.05**: Complete a simple if/then algorithm
- **T01.G2.06**: Choose the best if/then rule for a situation

**Recommendation**: Appropriate progression. Keep both.

### Group 4: Trace and Fix
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G2.09**: Trace an algorithm that uses "repeat ___ times"
- **T01.G2.10**: Fix a repeat count that's wrong

**Analysis**: Direct prerequisite relationship. Trace first, then debug.

**Recommendation**: Appropriate progression. Keep both.

### Group 5: Testing and Debugging
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G2.13**: Create your own if/then algorithm for a simple task
- **T01.G2.14**: Test your algorithm on different examples
- **T01.G2.15**: Fix an algorithm that doesn't work for all cases

**Analysis**: This is a nice create → test → debug progression.

**Recommendation**: Consider consolidating into a single project-based skill with three components, OR keep as distinct skills for assessment purposes.

**NOTE**: All G3 skills have external dependencies. Be very cautious with changes.

### Group 1: Script Completion/Matching
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G3.01**: Complete a simple script with missing blocks
- **T01.G3.02**: Match a story description to a code sequence

**Analysis**: Both involve understanding code sequences. G3.01 is fill-in-the-blank, G3.02 is matching.

### Group 2: Repeated Blocks Recognition
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G3.03**: Identify repeated blocks in a script (no loops)

### Group 4: Debugging Triad
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G3.13**: Debug a program with steps in the wrong order
- **T01.G3.14**: Debug a loop that repeats the wrong number of times
- **T01.G3.15**: Debug an if/then that doesn't trigger when it should

**Analysis**: Three debugging skills, each targeting a specific concept (sequence, loops, conditionals).

**Recommendation**: Keep all three - each targets a different debugging scenario.

## Grade 4 (G4) - Potential Consolidations

### Group 1: Variable Tracking
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G4.07**: Trace a simple counter variable
- **T01.G4.08**: Add a variable to count events in a program
- **T01.G4.09**: Use a variable to track a simple game state (lives or points)

**Analysis**: All involve using variables for tracking. G4.07 is trace, G4.08 is add counter, G4.09 is game state.

**Recommendation**: G4.07 and G4.10 might overlap (both trace variables). Review for consolidation.

### Group 2: Loop Optimization
**Candidate for review**:

- **T01.G5.03**: Convert a short program into pseudocode

**Analysis**: Four skills about converting between representations (words ↔ flowchart ↔ code ↔ pseudocode).

**Recommendation**: These are appropriately distinct as they teach different representation conversions. However, note that G5.02.01 and G5.02.02 could potentially be combined into "Convert algorithm representations into code."

### Group 2: Algorithm Correctness
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G5.05**: Determine whether an algorithm is correct for all inputs
- **T01.G5.07**: Debug an algorithm that mis-handles a simple edge case
- **T01.G5.08**: Add checks to handle edge cases

## Grade 8 (G8) - Potential Consolidations

### Group 1: Recursion Introduction
**Candidate for review**:
- **T01.G8.04**: Identify base case and recursive step in an algorithm description

## Cross-Grade Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Match" Skills
Skills that ask students to match representations:
- T01.G1.09, T01.G1.10, T01.G2.04, T01.G3.02, T01.G3.09, T01.G5.01

**Analysis**: These appear across multiple grades with increasing complexity.

**Recommendation**: Ensure each has distinct value and isn't just repeating the same skill.

### Pattern 2: "Trace" Skills
Skills that ask students to trace/follow an algorithm:
- T01.G2.09, T01.G2.12, T01.G3.06, T01.G3.10, T01.G4.07, T01.G4.10, T01.G5.04, T01.G7.04, T01.G8.05

**Analysis**: Tracing appears frequently, with increasing complexity.

**Recommendation**: This is appropriate - tracing is a fundamental skill that scaffolds from simple to complex.

### Pattern 3: "Debug" Skills
Skills focused on debugging:
- T01.G2.10, T01.G2.15, T01.G3.13, T01.G3.14, T01.G3.15, T01.G4.11, T01.G5.07

**Analysis**: Debugging is a repeated theme with different targets (sequences, loops, conditionals, edge cases).

**Recommendation**: Appropriate. Debugging should be practiced across different contexts.

## Recommendations Summary

### High Priority Consolidations

1. **T01.GK.08** (Simple pattern game)
   - Consider making this an implementation note for T01.GK.07 rather than a separate skill
   - Rationale: Seems like a practice activity rather than a distinct learning objective

2. **T01.G5.02.01 and T01.G5.02.02**
   - Consider combining into "Convert algorithm representations (flowchart/pseudocode) into code"
   - Rationale: Both are about converting non-code representations to code; distinction may not be significant

### Medium Priority Reviews

1. **T01.G2.13, T01.G2.14, T01.G2.15**
   - Review if these should be a single project-based skill or remain separate
   - Rationale: They form a natural create → test → debug cycle

2. **T01.G4.07 and T01.G4.10**
   - Review for potential overlap
   - Rationale: Both involve tracing variables; ensure they're distinct

3. **T01.G1.10 and T01.G2.04**
   - Review if both are needed
   - Rationale: Seem to teach the same matching skill

### Low Priority Reviews

Most other skill sequences show appropriate progressions and should be kept as-is.

## Skills to Definitely Keep Separate

1. **Create → Test → Debug progressions** (e.g., G2.13-15, G4.03-05)
2. **Trace → Fix progressions** (e.g., G2.09-10, G3.13-15)
3. **Recognize → Apply progressions** (e.g., G7.01-02)
4. **Analyze → Improve progressions** (e.g., G6.03-04, G7.06-07)

These progressions are pedagogically sound and should be preserved.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review high-priority candidates with curriculum team
2. Test consolidations with sample implementations
3. Ensure any consolidations maintain assessment granularity
4. Update dependency chains if skills are consolidated
