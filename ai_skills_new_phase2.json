    "description": "Students analyze and evaluate tradeoffs between different data representations: detailed vs. simple, accurate vs. usable, precise vs. understandable. They examine real examples (e.g., weather forecasts, nutritional labels, maps) and discuss: What information is emphasized? What is hidden or simplified? Who benefits from this representation? They learn that representation choices involve tradeoffs and reflect priorities.",

    "description": "Students create feature vectors to represent data for an AI classification task. For example, representing animals for classification: [has_fur: 1, number_of_legs: 4, can_fly: 0, habitat: 'land']. They understand that: (1) AI needs data in numerical/categorical format, (2) choosing the right features is crucial for AI performance, (3) some features are more informative than others, and (4) representation affects what the AI can learn. This bridges representation to machine learning.",
