## Implementation Recommendations

### For Curriculum Designers

**Sequencing:**
1. Integrate Grade 6 skills in Q3 (after students have T06-T10 programming basics)
2. Integrate Grade 7 skills across Q3-Q4 (during project time)
3. Integrate Grade 8 skills in Q4 (competition preparation period)

**Project Timing:**
- Allocate 8-10 weeks for complete project development
- Use new skills as milestones throughout project timeline
- Build in iteration time (testing → improvement → retesting)

**Assessment:**
- Use auto-grading for objective elements (format, completeness)
- Use rubrics for subjective elements (quality, clarity)
- Require portfolio submissions showing iteration

### For Teachers

**Scaffolding Strategies:**

**For Grade 6:**
- Provide templates for all writing tasks
- Use think-pair-share for peer feedback
- Model presentations before students create theirs

- Emphasize iteration and improvement

**For Grade 8:**
- Minimal templates (competition requirements only)
- Expect professional-quality work
