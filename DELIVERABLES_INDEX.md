## Quick Answers to Key Questions

### Q1: Are the 20 skills too focused on Congressional App Challenge?

**A:** ✅ **FIXED**

All documentation now emphasizes "App & Project Development Skills" supporting:
- Congressional App Challenge
- Games for Change
- Science Fairs
- ICode Global Hackathon
- Codeavour
- General creative app/game development

**Files to read:**
- WEEK2_REFRAMED_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
- CREATIVE_PROJECT_PATHWAY.md

---

### Q2: Do the 20 skills balance technical and creative aspects?

**A:** ✅ **YES - 75% creative**

**Breakdown:**
- Strong Creative: 8 skills (40%)
- Balanced: 7 skills (35%)
- Technical: 5 skills (25%)

**Recommendations:** Add 3 more creative skills (visual theme, delightful details, ideation) → 82% creative

**Files to read:**
- WEEK2_CREATIVITY_ANALYSIS.md
- WEEK2_REFRAMED_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (bottom section)

---

### Q3: What should be added for better creativity balance?

**A:** 3 high-value skills recommended:

1. **T20.G7.05 - Design a Visual Theme**
   - Color palette selection
   - Typography principles
   - Visual coherence
   - Accessibility considerations

2. **T16.G7.06 - Add Delightful Details**
   - Microinteractions
   - Easter eggs and surprises
   - Playful microcopy
   - User joy

3. **T05.G6.07 - Brainstorm Creative Solutions**
   - Ideation techniques
   - Creative thinking methods
   - Innovation processes

**File to read:** WEEK2_CREATIVITY_ANALYSIS.md (Recommendations section)

---

### Q4: How much ACSL content needs to be removed?

**A:** ✅ **Very little - mostly reframing needed**

**Numbers:**
- **EXCLUDE (competition-only):** 3 skills
- **DE-EMPHASIZE (optional):** 5 skills
- **REFRAME (better language):** 6 skills
- **KEEP AS-IS:** 40+ skills are fine

**Key Insight:** Most "theoretical" skills are actually practical when you read them. Issue is mostly jargon in titles/descriptions.

**File to read:** ACSL_CONTENT_EXCLUSION.md

---

### Q5: What was Week 1's T10.G8.02 fix?

**A:** ✅ **The correct pattern for handling theoretical content**

**Before Week 1:**
- T10.G8.02: "Implement a sorting algorithm" (too theoretical for everyone)

**After Week 1:**
- **T10.G8.02 (Standard):** "Use sorting tools to organize data" (practical)
- **T10.G8.02-ADV (Competition):** "Implement sorting algorithm" (theoretical)
  - Marked: `difficulty_track: "competition"`
  - Tagged: `competition_tags: ['ACSL_junior']`

**This pattern should be applied to 3 other theoretical skills.**

**File to read:** ACSL_CONTENT_EXCLUSION.md (T10.G8.02 section)
