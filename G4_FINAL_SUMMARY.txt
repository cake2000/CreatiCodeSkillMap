================================================================================
ISSUE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

1. OUT OF ORDER DEPENDENCIES: 0 (HIGH priority)
   - G4 depending on G5+ skills
   - Result: NONE FOUND - EXCELLENT

2. DEPENDENCY RANGE VIOLATIONS: 37 (MEDIUM priority)
   - G4 should only depend on G2, G3, or G4
   - Found: 37 skills depending on GK or G1 (too far back)
   - Breakdown:
     * 15 skills depend on GK (Kindergarten) - 4 grades back
     * 22 skills depend on G1 - 3 grades back

3. CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES: 0 (HIGH priority)
   - Skills depending on each other in a cycle
   - Result: NONE FOUND - EXCELLENT

4. TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES: 0 significant (LOW priority)
   - Direct listing of dependencies already covered by other deps
   - Result: No major issues

5. SAME-TOPIC SAME-GRADE DEPENDENCIES: 0 (LOW priority)
   - Redundant listing of skills in same topic/grade
   - Result: No issues found

6. MISSING DEPENDENCIES: Not systematically detected
   - Would require semantic analysis of skill content

7. OVERLY BROAD SKILLS: Not detected
   - No skills flagged as trying to cover too much

================================================================================
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF ISSUES
================================================================================

Example 1: T01.G4.02 - Implement a written plan in code
  Current dependency: T01.GK.08 (Kindergarten)
  Issue: Skips G1, G2, G3 entirely
  Fix: Replace with appropriate G2 or G3 skill from T01 topic

Example 2: T05.G4.01 - Identify key details in a user persona
  Current dependency: T05.G1.01 (Grade 1)
  Issue: Skips G2, G3
  Fix: Add or reference G2/G3 intermediate skills in human-centered design

Example 3: T02.G4.01 - Add a loop to an existing flowchart
  Current dependency: T02.GK.04 (Kindergarten)
  Issue: Jumps from kindergarten flowchart basics to G4 loops
  Fix: Reference G2/G3 flowchart skills instead

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (must fix):
  - No HIGH priority issues found (no forward refs, no circular deps)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (should fix):
  - Fix all 37 range violations
  - For each topic with issues, identify or create G2/G3 intermediate skills
  - Update G4 dependencies to reference these intermediate skills

LOW PRIORITY (nice to have):
  - Review skills with no dependencies to ensure they're truly foundational
  - Check for any missing semantic prerequisites

================================================================================
SPECIFIC FIX APPROACH
================================================================================

For each of the 37 skills with range violations:

Step 1: Identify the conceptual prerequisite
  - What knowledge does this G4 skill actually require?

Step 2: Find or create appropriate G2/G3 stepping stone
  - Look for existing G2/G3 skills in same topic
  - If none exist, create intermediate skills

Step 3: Update dependency
  - Replace GK/G1 dependency with G2/G3 dependency
  - Ensure smooth progression path exists

Step 4: Validate
  - Check that new dependency is in valid range (G2-G4)
  - Verify no circular dependencies created
  - Ensure prerequisite makes semantic sense

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The G4 skill set is in GOOD overall condition:

STRENGTHS:
  - No forward references (G4 -> G5+)
  - No circular dependencies
  - 77.2% of skills have proper dependency structure
  - Clean dependency graph for most coding/game topics (T06-T15)

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
  - 37 skills (22.8%) have range violations
  - Mainly affects conceptual/theory topics (T01-T05, T25, T30, T32, T35, T36)
  - Need G2/G3 intermediate skills in affected topics

EFFORT REQUIRED:
  - Medium - Systematic but straightforward fixes
  - Review 10 affected topics
  - Update 37 skill dependencies
  - Possibly create some G2/G3 intermediate skills

IMPACT:
  - Fixes will create smoother learning progression
  - Ensures proper scaffolding from kindergarten to grade 4
  - Maintains X, X-1, X-2 dependency rule consistency
