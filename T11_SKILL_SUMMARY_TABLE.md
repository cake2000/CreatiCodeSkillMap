## Cross-Topic Dependencies

T11 skills depend on skills from:
- **T06 (Events):** Script structure understanding
- **T07 (Loops):** Comparison context
- **T08 (Conditionals):** Using blocks in conditions
- **T09 (Variables):** Data flow and display

## CreatiCode-Specific Syntax

- Block creation: `define (BlockName (param))`
- Parameter access: `argument (param)`
- Command call: `call BlockName [value]`
- Reporter call: `report BlockName [value]`
- Return value: `return [value]`
- Comment: `// [comment]`
