HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (MUST DO BEFORE LAUNCH)
===================================================================

FIX #1: CORRECT GRADE 6 INTRA-TOPIC DEPENDENCIES (X-2 RULE)
----------------------------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md, lines 4082-4140
Issue: All 5 Grade 6 skills depend on Grade 3 skills (3-grade gap)
Impact: Violates X-2 rule; unrealistic prerequisite chains

Action Items:

1. T09.G6.01 (Use variables to represent real-world quantities)
   CURRENT dependencies (line 4087-4091):
   * T09.G3.01: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count
   * T09.G3.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
   * T09.G5.07: Trace a counter variable in a loop

   AFTER FIX - REMOVE these two:
   - Remove: T09.G3.01
   - Remove: T09.G3.02
   (Keep G5.07 and G5.08)

2. T09.G6.02 (Use expressions with mixed operators and precedence)

   CURRENT dependencies (line 4112-4115):
   * T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
   * T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
   * T09.G3.01: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count
   * T09.G5.08: Trace an accumulator that sums values

   AFTER FIX - REPLACE:
   - Remove: T09.G3.01
   - Add: T09.G5.05: Use variables to track cumulative statistics

4. T09.G6.04 (Trace and debug variable-dependent logic)

   AFTER FIX - REPLACE:
   - Remove: T09.G3.01
   - Add: T09.G5.05 or T09.G5.03 (Use variables to configure behavior)

FIX #2: CORRECT GRADE 7 DEPENDENCY LABEL ERROR
-----------------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md, lines 4142-4165
Issue: G7.01 and G7.02 list wrong skill ID for dependency
Impact: Documentation error; prerequisite confusion

Current Problem:
  T09.G7.01 and T09.G7.02 both list:
  * T09.G5.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)

  BUT actual T09.G5.02 is: "Use string variables and concatenation"
  The description doesn't match the skill!

Action Items:

1. T09.G7.01 (Use variables to store and update state in simulations)
   Line 4148-4151
   CHANGE FROM:
   * T09.G5.01: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count
   * T09.G5.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
   * T09.G6.04: Trace and debug variable-dependent logic
   * T09.G6.05: Use variables to store intermediate results

   CHANGE TO:
   * T09.G5.01: Use multiple variables together in expressions
   * T09.G5.02: Use string variables and concatenation
   * T09.G6.04: Trace and debug variable-dependent logic
   * T09.G6.05: Use variables to store intermediate results
   (Only line with T09.G5.01 changes from "Create and use" to "Use multiple")

2. T09.G7.02 (Use aggregate expressions - sum, average, min, max)
   Line 4160-4163
   SAME CHANGE AS G7.01

Alternative (if conditional logic is genuinely needed for G7):
  Check if G7.01/G7.02 genuinely need variable-in-conditional skills.
  If so, the dependency should reference T09.G3.02 (Grade 3 conditional)
  and be explicitly justified in the description.

---

FIX #3: K-2 CURRICULUM DECISION (REQUIRED)
-------------------------------------------
Location: None (curriculum decision, not code change)
Issue: No T09 skills for K-2; topic starts at Grade 3
Impact: Possible gap in foundational variable concepts

Decision Required: Choose ONE path

PATH A: ADD K-2 UNPLUGGED SKILLS
  Action: Work with curriculum team to add:
  - T09.K.01 or T09.G1.01: Unplugged variable concept
    (e.g., "number boxes" activity where values change)
  - T09.G2.01: Picture-based variables in puzzles

  When ready, create new skill cards for K-2 in skillsv4/allskills.md

PATH B: DOCUMENT WHY T09 STARTS AT G3
  Action: Add curriculum note before T09.G3.01:
  "T09 Skills (Variables & Expressions): Instruction begins at Grade 3
   when students are developmentally ready for block-based programming.
   Grades K-2 focus on sequencing and simple loops (Topics T06-T07)
   without variables. Variable concepts are formally introduced at Grade 3."

  This clarifies the design choice and reassures educators.

Recommendation: Choose PATH A or PATH B, then implement.

===================================================================
MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES (IMPROVE QUALITY)
===================================================================

FIX #4: REMOVE CONDITIONAL LOGIC PREREQUISITE FROM T09.G3.01
----------------------------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md, line 3869
Issue: G3.01 unnecessarily depends on T08.G3.01 (conditionals)
Impact: Artificial prerequisite delays variable instruction

Current (line 3868-3870):
Dependencies:
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T03.G2.01: Choose subtasks for a simple project idea

After Fix - REMOVE the T08.G3.01 line:
Dependencies:
* T03.G2.01: Choose subtasks for a simple project idea

Rationale: Variable creation (setting a value) is simpler than
conditionals (checking a value). They can be taught independently.

---

FIX #5: CLARIFY G3.01 VS G3.04 DISTINCTION
-------------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md, lines 3865-3866 and 3897-3898
Issue: Both G3.01 and G3.04 address variable concepts ambiguously
Impact: Unclear what distinguishes "create" from "trace"

Current G3.01 (line 3865-3866):
Skill: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count
Description: Students create their first numeric variable with a
simple name (e.g., `score`), set it to 0 at the start, and update
it by 1 when something obvious happens (like touching a star).
This gateway skill introduces the fundamental concept that programs
can remember and change numbers. Focus on the create-set-change
pattern with very simple increments.

IMPROVE TO:
Skill: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count
Description: Students actively create their first numeric variable
(e.g., a 'score' variable), initialize it to 0, and modify it when
events occur (e.g., change score by 1 when touching a star). This
hands-on skill teaches the create-set-change pattern and builds
understanding that variables store and update values. Focus on
practical creation and modification in code blocks.

Current G3.04 (line 3897-3898):
Skill: Trace code with variables to predict outcomes
Description: Students trace a very short script (3-4 steps) where a
variable changes in simple ways (set to 0, change by 1, change by 1
again), and predict the final value. Use small numbers and obvious
changes. Focus on the basic concept of following how variables
change step by step.

IMPROVE TO:
Skill: Trace code with variables to predict outcomes
Description: Students read pre-written code and mentally trace how
a variable's value changes through a short script (3-4 steps),
predicting the final value without creating new variables. Examples:
a variable set to 0, then changed by 1 twice (predict 2). This
skill builds the mental model of variable state progression through
code execution.

FIX #6: REVIEW GRADE 4 SKILL CONSOLIDATION (OPTIONAL)
------------------------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md, lines 3906-4000
Issue: Grade 4 has 8 skills (2x typical grade load)
Impact: May be overwhelming for teachers; some skills could consolidate

Current Grade 4 Skills (8 total):
1. G4.01: Use multiplication and division in expressions
2. G4.02: Combine operators and variables in complex expressions
3. G4.03: Store and use user input in a variable
4. G4.04: Use variables in a loop counter pattern
5. G4.05: Use comparison operators in expressions
6. G4.06: Use boolean variables to track states
7. G4.07: Modify a variable based on sensor or random input
8. G4.08: Debug incorrect variable updates in code

Consolidation Candidates:

Option 1: Merge G4.01 + G4.02 (Operators)
  New skill: "Use arithmetic operators (*, /, +, -) in expressions"
  Move G4.02 to G5 or make optional extension

Option 2: Merge G4.03 + G4.07 (Inputs)
  New skill: "Modify variables using external inputs (user, sensor, random)"
  Combines both input types into single skill

Option 3: Move G4.05 to G5
  G4.05 (comparison operators) is more analytical than practical
  G5 students would be ready for this analytical perspective

Recommendation: Review with curriculum team. If consolidating,
choose Option 1 or 2 (not Option 3 alone). This brings G4 to 6-7
skills, more consistent with other grades.

---

FIX #7: CLARIFY DEBUGGING SKILL PROGRESSION (4 SKILLS)
-------------------------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md
Issue: 4 debugging skills but progression unclear
Impact: Confusing assessment criteria; overlapping descriptions

Skills to clarify:
- T09.G3.03 (line 3885-3887): Debug missing or wrong variable updates
- T09.G4.08 (line 3990-3992): Debug incorrect variable updates in code
- T09.G6.04 (line 4120-4121): Trace and debug variable-dependent logic
- T09.G8.04 (line 4231-4232): Debug variable-related logical errors

REWRITE DESCRIPTIONS TO SHOW DISTINCT LEVELS:

G3.03 (Simple/Obvious):
FROM: "Students inspect a very simple script where a variable
obviously doesn't work right (e.g., `score` stays at 0 even after
touching stars). The missing piece should be clear (missing 'set
score to 0' or missing 'change score by 1'). This contextualized
debugging skill teaches debugging as a natural part of learning
variables, with obvious problems and straightforward fixes."

TO: "Students debug obvious errors in simple variable code:
missing initialization (no 'set score to 0'), missing updates
(no 'change score by 1'), or variables used before creation.
Scope: Single variable, 1-2 code blocks. Examples: score stays 0
because increment block is missing, or variable not initialized."

G4.08 (Initialization/Usage):
FROM: "Students examine a program where a variable is initialized,
modified, or used incorrectly (e.g., not initialized, updated too
many times, used in the wrong place) and fix it to achieve the
intended behavior."

TO: "Students debug variable errors involving initialization order
and incorrect usage: variables used before being set, modified in
the wrong block, or incorrect scope placement. Scope: Multiple
variables across multiple blocks. Examples: variable referenced
before declaration, or variable modified when it should only be
read in a conditional."

G6.04 (Logic-Dependent):
FROM: "Students analyze a script with variable assignments and
expressions, identify where a variable has an incorrect value or
is used wrong, and fix the issue to achieve intended behavior."

TO: "Students debug errors where variable values are correct but
used incorrectly in conditional logic: off-by-one errors in
comparisons (>= vs >), wrong conditional branch checked, or
variable not updated when condition is true. Scope: Variables in
conditionals and simple loops."

G8.04 (Complex State/Scope):
FROM: "Students identify and fix bugs related to variable scope,
initialization order, incorrect update expressions, or misuse of
variables in conditionals. Debugging is more sophisticated,
involving tracing across multiple blocks or loops."

TO: "Students debug complex variable errors in algorithms:
variable scope conflicts, state not maintained correctly across
nested loops, initialization timing in complex structures, or
variable dependencies in multi-step expressions. Scope: Nested
loops, multiple interconnected variables, iterative algorithms."

---

FIX #8: ADD UNPLUGGED CONTEXT TO GRADE 3 SKILLS (OPTIONAL)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md, lines 3866, 3876, 3887, 3898
Issue: All G3 descriptions assume block-based coding only
Impact: Educators unsure if K-3 can use unplugged introduction

For each Grade 3 skill (G3.01, G3.02, G3.03, G3.04), consider adding:

Option A: Single note at topic top (before G3.01):
"Grade 3 variable skills can be taught through unplugged activities
(e.g., 'number boxes' using cards/paper to represent variables,
'if cards' for conditionals) before or alongside block-based coding."

Option B: Add to each G3 description:
G3.01 - Add to description:
"Note: Can be introduced using unplugged 'number boxes' activity
where students change card values before coding."

G3.02 - Add to description:
"Note: Can be introduced using unplugged 'if card' games before
coding in blocks."

G3.03 - Add to description:
"Note: Debugging concepts can be taught with paper-based variable
tracking before block-based debugging."

G3.04 - Add to description:
"Note: Tracing can be practiced on paper (manual execution) before
code-based tracing."

Recommendation: Choose Option A (cleaner) or add individually
if unplugged activities are core to G3 instruction.

===================================================================

FIX #9: REVIEW T09.G7.02 FOR OVERLAP WITH T10 (LISTS)
------------------------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md, line 4156-4157
Issue: Aggregate expressions (sum, average, min, max) may overlap
with T10 (Lists & Tables) curriculum
Impact: Possible redundant teaching between topics

Current G7.02:
Skill: Use aggregate expressions (sum, average, min, max)
Description: Students write expressions or use blocks to compute
aggregate statistics (sum, average, minimum, maximum) over
variables or lists, connecting expressions to data analysis.

Action: Cross-check with T10 curriculum
- If T10 already covers aggregates on lists: Consider moving
  G7.02 to T10 or clarifying that G7.02 is variables-specific
- If T10 doesn't cover aggregates: Keep G7.02 in T09
- If both cover it: Clarify distinction (T09 = variables, T10 = lists)

Note: Not urgent if topics are well-coordinated.

---

FIX #10: CLARIFY T09.G5.03 DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------
Location: skillsv4/allskills.md, line 4024-4025
Issue: Description uses "parameters" language confusingly
Impact: Unclear what distinguishes this from regular variables

Current:
ID: T09.G5.03
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Use variables to configure behavior (parameters without functions)
Description: Students create variables that configure behavior
(e.g., speed, difficulty, number of lives) and use them in
expressions to control program settings, introducing the idea of
parameterization.

Problem: "Parameters without functions" is confusing for Grade 5
students who haven't learned functions yet. The "parameters" language
suggests function concepts prematurely.

REWRITE TO:
Skill: Use variables to control program behavior
Description: Students create configuration variables (such as speed,
difficulty, or lives) that control how the program runs. These are
typically set once at the start and used throughout the program to
change settings or behavior. Example: a 'difficulty' variable that
controls enemy speed or obstacle frequency.

Alternative simpler version:
Skill: Use global variables for program settings
Description: Students create variables that configure overall
program behavior (speed, difficulty, lives, etc.) and use them
throughout the program to control behavior. These "setting variables"
are initialized once and referenced whenever that setting is needed.
