---

## EXECUTIVE RECOMMENDATION

**Proceed with optimization. T35 is fundamentally well-designed but requires moderate restructuring in grades 6-8 to improve teachability and learnability.**

### What's Working Well
- Excellent K-5 progression with age-appropriate activities
- Comprehensive AI ethics coverage across all AI types (T21-T24)
- Strong integration with computing skills (widgets, data, AI)
- No major content gaps or duplicate skills
- Good thematic progression from basic digital citizenship to advanced ethics

### What Needs Improvement
- 13 skills in G6-G8 are too broad with multiple learning objectives
- 4 missing scaffolding skills create abrupt conceptual jumps
- 3 skills have vague descriptions that hinder implementation
- Some G6-G8 skills approach near-adult complexity levels

### Recommended Actions
1. **Split 13 overly broad skills into 37 focused skills** (maintains same content, better organization)
2. **Add 4 scaffolding skills** to smooth transitions between grade levels
3. **Clarify 3 vague descriptions** to support consistent implementation
4. **Verify 1 cross-topic dependency** to ensure proper sequencing

### Expected Outcomes
- **Clearer learning objectives** - Each skill has one focused outcome
- **Better pacing** - Students tackle manageable chunks toward complex goals
- **Easier teaching** - Teachers plan focused lessons with clear targets
- **Easier assessment** - Can evaluate specific competencies
- **Reduced overwhelm** - Complex projects broken into sequential steps
- **Maintained rigor** - Same comprehensive coverage, better structured

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. OVERLY BROAD SKILLS (Critical Issue)

**13 skills require splitting** (primarily in G6-G8):

#### Grade 6 Problems (4 skills)
- **T35.G6.01**: Combines 3 ethics frameworks (beneficence, fairness, autonomy) → Split into 4
- **T35.G6.03.01**: Tests 2 different AI types (T21, T22) with different criteria → Split into 2
- **T35.G6.03.03**: Guidelines for 2 different AI types (T23, T24) → Split into 2
- **T35.G6.05.02**: Implements 4 separate features (view, delete, update, export) → Split into 2

#### Grade 7 Problems (5 skills)
- **T35.G7.01.01**: Framework + audits for 2 AI types → Split into 3
- **T35.G7.04.01**: 3 different tracking systems in one project → Split into 3
- **T35.G7.04.02**: 4 major activities (analysis, research, debate, guidelines) → Split into 2
- **T35.G7.05.01**: Multiple experiment types + time studies → Split into 3
- **T35.G7.05.02**: Research + debates + policy drafting → Split into 3

#### Grade 8 Problems (2 skills)
- **T35.G8.02**: Research + data collection + visualization + policy writing → Split into 3
- **T35.G8.03.01**: 4 assessment categories with complex rubrics → Split into 4

**Impact:** Splitting creates 37 focused skills from 13 broad ones (net +24 skills)

---

### 2. MISSING SCAFFOLDING (High Priority)

**4 new skills needed** to bridge conceptual gaps:

1. **T35.G2.05** - Introduction to digital ethics tools (G2→G3 bridge)
   - *Problem:* G2 ends with unplugged activities, G3 starts with complex block-based projects
   - *Solution:* Explore simple ethics tools to prepare for coding them

2. **T35.G5.05** - Introduction to ethics frameworks (G5→G6 bridge)
   - *Problem:* G6 immediately applies complex frameworks with no introduction
   - *Solution:* Learn beneficence, fairness, autonomy concepts through simple scenarios

3. **T35.G6.03.00** - Explore AI bias concepts (before G6 AI testing)
   - *Problem:* Students test for bias without understanding what bias means in AI
   - *Solution:* Learn bias types, causes, and impacts before systematic testing

4. **T35.G7.04.00** - Research surveillance technology uses (before G7 simulator)
   - *Problem:* Students build surveillance simulator without real-world context
   - *Solution:* Research actual surveillance cases to understand ethical landscape

**Impact:** Smoother transitions, better conceptual foundation, reduced overwhelm

---

### 3. VAGUE DESCRIPTIONS (Medium Priority)

**3 skills need clarification** for consistent implementation:

1. **T35.G5.02** - "Debate digital well-being scenarios"
   - *Problem:* Doesn't specify what evidence or how to obtain it
   - *Fix:* Add: "Students research evidence from 2-3 provided articles/studies..."

2. **T35.G6.04** - "Examine digital divide data"
   - *Problem:* Unclear what "propose community actions" means
   - *Fix:* Add: "Propose 2-3 specific, realistic community actions with justification..."

3. **T35.G8.01.01** - "Analyze AI chatbots' impact on information literacy"
   - *Problem:* Description incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in file)
   - *Fix:* Complete full description with specific analysis activities

**Impact:** Teachers know exactly what to teach, students know what to do

**Other Topics** (T01, T03, T06, T08, T09) - LIGHT DEPENDENCIES ✓
- Foundational skills properly prerequisite

### Dependencies Other Topics Have On T35

- **T31 (Internet & Cloud)** - References T35 ethics requirements ✓
- **T32 (Cybersecurity)** - Multiple references to T35 frameworks ✓
- **T34 (Computing History)** - Thematic connections to equity ✓

### Dependency Health

- **0 confirmed X-2 rule violations** within T35
- **1 dependency to verify** (T19.G5.01 timing)

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Skill Count Increase Overwhelms
**Concern:** 74 skills seems like too many for one topic
**Mitigation:**
- Same content coverage, just better organized
- Each skill is smaller and clearer
- Teachers can pace according to available time
- Not all skills are required for all students

### Risk 2: Split Skills Lose Context
**Concern:** Breaking apart big projects removes authentic experience
**Mitigation:**
- Skills remain sequenced (build one part, then next)
- Final skills integrate components (e.g., T35.G8.03.01d)
- Students still complete comprehensive projects, just in steps

### Risk 3: Implementation Timeline Too Long
**Concern:** 6-7 weeks is significant time investment
**Mitigation:**
- Can implement in phases (G6-G8 first, highest priority)
- Split work across team members
- Some changes are quick (descriptions, new IDs)

### Risk 4: Cross-Topic Dependencies Break
**Concern:** Splitting skills might create new dependency issues
**Mitigation:**
- Carefully track dependencies for all splits
- Verify T16, T19, T21-T24 progressions
- Test with sample learning paths
