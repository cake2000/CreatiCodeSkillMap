---

## ISSUE 1: Vague Verbs Needing Replacement with Active Verbs

### 1.1 T32.G3.02 - "Discuss how algorithms influence what we see"
**Current:** "Discuss how algorithms influence what we see"
**Problem:** "Discuss" is vague and passive
**Recommendation:** Change to "**Build and analyze** how algorithms influence what we see"
**Rationale:** The description already has students building a recommendation simulator - the skill name should reflect this active construction.

### 1.2 T32.G5.01 - "Research technology impacts in one community"
**Current:** "Research technology impacts in one community"
**Problem:** "Research" is vague about what students produce
**Recommendation:** "**Document** technology impacts in one community with evidence chart"
**Rationale:** Description specifies creating a summary chart from 3+ sources - skill should specify the deliverable.

### 1.3 T32.G5.04 - "Debate digital well-being scenarios"
**Current:** "Debate digital well-being scenarios"
**Problem:** "Debate" doesn't specify the cognitive skill
**Recommendation:** "**Argue** digital well-being positions using evidence"
**Rationale:** Description emphasizes using evidence, structured claim-evidence-reasoning format.

### 1.4 T32.G5.09 - "Manage and minimize digital footprints"
**Current:** "Manage and minimize digital footprints"
**Problem:** "Manage" is vague about the action
**Recommendation:** "**Audit and reduce** personal digital footprints"
**Rationale:** Description specifies auditing (searching name, reviewing permissions) and reducing strategies.

### 1.5 T32.G6.15 - "Analyze representation and barriers in computing careers"
**Current:** "Analyze representation and barriers in computing careers"
**Problem:** While "Analyze" is better, the skill is incomplete
**Recommendation:** "Analyze representation gaps and **propose** barrier solutions"
**Rationale:** Description requires proposing improvements - add this active output verb.

### 1.6 T32.G7.08 - "Identify unintended consequences of new tech"
**Current:** "Identify unintended consequences of new tech"
**Problem:** "Identify" alone is weak - description requires more
**Recommendation:** "**Predict and mitigate** unintended consequences of new tech"
**Rationale:** Description requires storyboarding consequences AND proposing specific mitigations.

### 1.7 T32.G7.15 - "Facilitate community discussions on AI-powered tech policy"
**Current:** "Facilitate community discussions on AI-powered tech policy"
**Problem:** "Facilitate" doesn't capture the interview/synthesis work
**Recommendation:** "**Conduct stakeholder interviews** and synthesize AI policy perspectives"
**Rationale:** Description specifies designing interviews, documenting responses, creating summary reports.

### 1.8 T32.G8.04.01 - "Design workshop curriculum for responsible tech"
**Current:** Uses "Plan" in description but "Design" in title - inconsistent with T32.G7.24
**Problem:** T32.G7.24 uses "Plan a lesson" but G8 uses "Design workshop curriculum" for similar tasks
**Recommendation:** Standardize terminology - use "**Plan** workshop curriculum for responsible tech"
**Rationale:** Maintain consistency with similar skills; "plan" is clearer for K-8 than "design curriculum."

---

## ISSUE 2: K-2 Skills Missing Picture Cards/Visual Scenarios

### 2.1 T32.G2.02 - "Plan balanced tech schedules"
**Current:** "Learners design a simple daily routine that includes device time, outdoor play, meals, and sleep using picture cards and timers."
**Problem:** Description mentions "picture cards" but skill name doesn't specify visual approach
**Status:** ACTUALLY OKAY - description does specify picture cards
**Recommendation:** No change needed, but ensure implementation provides picture cards

### 2.2 T32.G2.04 - "Distinguish public vs. private information"
**Current:** "Students sort information cards (name, favorite color, home address, birthday, pet's name) into 'okay to share online' and 'keep private' piles."
**Problem:** Uses "information cards" in description but skill name doesn't specify this is card sorting
**Status:** ACCEPTABLE - description is clear about cards
**Recommendation:** Consider renaming to "**Sort information cards** into public vs. private categories" for clarity

### 2.3 T32.G2.10 - "Sort information sources into trustworthy and not-sure categories"
**Current:** "Students sort picture cards showing information sources into two piles..."
**Status:** GOOD - already specifies picture cards in description
**Recommendation:** No change needed

### 2.4 T32.G1.06 - "Sort technology scenarios into helps vs causes problems categories"
**Current:** "Students sort picture cards showing technology scenarios..."
**Status:** GOOD - already specifies picture cards
**Recommendation:** No change needed

**CONCLUSION:** K-2 skills actually do specify visual approaches in descriptions. Only minor clarity improvements needed.

---

## ISSUE 3: Duplicate or Overlapping Skills

### 3.1 DUPLICATE: Career exploration skills across G1-G2
**Skills:**
- T32.G1.05: "Sort picture cards of jobs that use computers"
- T32.G2.08: "Name jobs where people create digital things"

**Problem:** Both involve identifying tech jobs with picture cards at nearly the same level
**Evidence:**
- T32.G2.08 depends on T32.G1.05 (and T32.GK.07)
- Both use similar picture card sorting methodology
- Difference is marginal (uses computers vs creates digital things)

**Recommendation:**
- Keep T32.G1.05 as broad exposure: "Sort jobs into uses-computers vs doesn't-use-computers"
- Refocus T32.G2.08: "**Categorize** digital creator jobs by what they make (games, apps, art, music)"
- This creates clearer progression: G1 = awareness, G2 = categorization

### 3.2 OVERLAP: Digital footprint skills G3 vs G5
**Skills:**
- T32.G3.01: "Build digital footprint checker with warning labels"
- T32.G5.09: "Manage and minimize digital footprints"

**Problem:** Both address digital footprints but G3 is more technical (builds checker) while G5 is more conceptual (personal audit)
**Status:** ACCEPTABLE OVERLAP - different focus (technical project vs personal practice)
**Recommendation:** Clarify T32.G3.01 name to "Build **automated** digital footprint checker" to emphasize the technical building vs personal audit distinction

### 3.3 DUPLICATE: Accessibility testing across G4 sub-skills
**Skills:**
- T32.G4.05: "Test game for audio accessibility"
- T32.G4.05.01: "Test game for visual accessibility"
- T32.G4.05.02: "Test game for input accessibility"

**Problem:** These are correctly structured as sub-skills but the numbering creates confusion
**Current Structure:** Main skill (T32.G4.05) is one of three types, not parent skill
**Recommendation:** Restructure numbering:
- T32.G4.05.01: "Test game for audio accessibility"
- T32.G4.05.02: "Test game for visual accessibility"
- T32.G4.05.03: "Test game for input accessibility"
- T32.G4.05.04: "Create accessibility testing checklist tool" (combines all three)
- Remove current T32.G4.05 as separate skill OR make it a parent "Conduct accessibility testing" skill

### 3.4 OVERLAP: Ethics evaluation tools G6-G8
**Skills:**
- T32.G6.07: "Build ethics evaluation tool combining all lenses"
- T32.G8.01-03: "Build accessibility and privacy assessment modules" (multi-module impact tool)

**Problem:** Both build comprehensive ethics/impact evaluation tools
**Analysis:**
- G6.07 focuses on three ethics lenses (beneficence, fairness, autonomy)
- G8.01-03 builds four-module tool (accessibility, privacy, wellbeing, cultural sensitivity)
- Different frameworks but similar "build comprehensive evaluation tool" approach

**Recommendation:**
- Keep both but clarify scope difference in names
- T32.G6.07: "Build ethics lens evaluation tool (beneficence, fairness, autonomy)"
- T32.G8.01: "Build **multi-framework** impact assessment tool (accessibility, privacy, wellbeing, culture)"

### 3.5 OVERLAP: AI bias testing G6 vs G7
**Skills:**
- T32.G6.01: "Test AI image generation for bias"
- T32.G6.02: "Test AI chatbots for accuracy and inclusivity"
- T32.G7.07: "Conduct bias audits for AI content generation (T20-T21)"

**Problem:** G7.07 appears to repeat what G6.01-02 already cover
**Analysis:** Looking at descriptions:
- G6.01-02: Test specific AI tools, log results to tables
- G7.07: "systematically audit T20 image generation... and T21 chatbots" - measures disparities, analyzes root causes, proposes mitigation

**Recommendation:** G7.07 should build on G6 testing by adding systematic analysis
- Rename T32.G7.07: "**Systematize** bias audits with disparity analysis and mitigation strategies"
- Clarify it extends G6 testing with formal audit methodology

---

## ISSUE 4: Skills Too Broad - Need Breakdown into Sub-Skills

### 4.1 T32.G5.05 - "Analyze AI's differential impacts on workers and communities"
**Current Description:** "Learners research how AI affects different communities unequally: which jobs are most at risk, how impacts vary by education/income level, geographic disparities in AI adoption, and how T20-T23 AI tools might worsen or improve equity. They propose reskilling and policy solutions with social justice focus."

**Problem:** This is 4-5 distinct skills combined into one:
1. Identifying jobs at risk
2. Analyzing demographic disparities (education/income)
3. Examining geographic disparities
4. Proposing solutions

**Recommendation:** Break into sequence:
- T32.G5.05a: "Identify which job types are most vulnerable to AI displacement"
- T32.G5.05b: "Analyze how AI impacts vary by demographic group (education, income)"
- T32.G5.05c: "Compare AI adoption disparities across geographic regions"
- T32.G5.05d: "Propose equity-focused reskilling and policy solutions"

**OR:** Narrow G5.05 to just analysis and move solutions to separate skill:
- T32.G5.05: "Analyze AI's differential impacts across worker and community demographics"
- T32.G5.05a: "Propose equity-focused solutions for AI displacement"

### 4.2 T32.G6.09 - "Synthesize comprehensive AI ethics guidelines"
**Current Description:** Combines testing dashboard analysis, creating interactive guidelines document, developing decision frameworks, and presenting as widget-based tool

**Problem:** Bundles synthesis, framework development, AND tool building
**Recommendation:** Consider breaking into:
- T32.G6.09a: "Analyze AI testing data to identify bias patterns"
- T32.G6.09b: "Create decision frameworks for ethical AI use"
- T32.G6.09c: "Build interactive AI ethics reference tool"

**OR:** Keep combined but clarify the synthesis focus in name:
- "Synthesize comprehensive AI ethics guidelines **from testing data**"

### 4.3 T32.G8.17-20 - AI workforce impact sequence
**Current:**
- T32.G8.17: "Analyze AI impact on workforce: displacement vs augmentation"
- T32.G8.18: "Identify jobs augmented vs displaced by AI"
- T32.G8.19: "Analyze patterns in AI workforce disruption"
- T32.G8.20: "Analyze how AI impacts vary by community"

**Problem:** G8.17 and G8.18 substantially overlap - both categorize jobs by AI impact
**Analysis:**
- G8.17: "Jobs at risk... jobs augmented... create comparison chart"
- G8.18: "categorize jobs into three groups: displaced, augmented, new jobs created"
- These are the same task with slightly different framing

**Recommendation:** Merge and restructure:
- T32.G8.17: "Categorize jobs as displaced, augmented, or created by AI"
- T32.G8.18: "Analyze patterns across AI-impacted job categories"
- T32.G8.19: "Examine how AI workforce impacts vary by community demographics"
- T32.G8.20: "Propose equitable AI deployment strategies" (rename current G8.21)

## ISSUE 5: Dependency Violations (X-2 Rule)

### 5.1 T32.G3.01 Dependency Violation
**Skill:** T32.G3.01 (Grade 3)
**Problematic Dependency:** T15.G3.01 (Grade 3) - OKAY
**Problematic Dependency:** T08.G3.04 (Grade 3) - OKAY
**Actually:** ALL dependencies are same grade or earlier - NO VIOLATION

Let me re-check all dependencies more carefully...

### 5.2 T32.G4.04 Dependency Check
**Skill:** T32.G4.04 (Grade 4)
**Dependencies:**
- T04.G3.01 (Grade 3) - OKAY (G4 can depend on G3)
- T06.G3.01 (Grade 3) - OKAY
- T07.G3.01 (Grade 3) - OKAY
- T15.G4.01 (Grade 4) - OKAY

- T05.G5.01 - OKAY
- T06.G5.01 - OKAY
- T08.G5.02 - OKAY
- T20.G6.01 - OKAY
- T32.G4.05 - **VIOLATION! G6 depending on G4 (only G6, G5, G4 allowed)**
- T32.G5.05 - OKAY

**VIOLATION FOUND:** T32.G6.01 depends on T32.G4.05 (accessibility testing)
**Recommendation:** Insert bridging skill at G5:
- T32.G5.XX: "Review accessibility testing principles for AI applications"
- This bridges G4 accessibility testing to G6 AI bias testing

### 5.5 T32.G6.04 Dependency Check
**Skill:** T32.G6.04 (Grade 6)
**Dependencies:**
- T05.G5.01 - OKAY
- T06.G5.01 - OKAY
- T08.G5.02 - OKAY
- T21.G6.01 - OKAY
- T32.G5.07 - OKAY

**Status:** NO VIOLATION

### 5.6 T32.G7.18 Dependency Check
**Skill:** T32.G7.18 (Grade 7)
**Dependencies:**
- T32.G6.18 - **ERROR: No such skill! Should be T32.G6.14 "Research and compare computing career clusters"**
- T32.G5.11 - **VIOLATION! G7 depending on G5 (only G7, G6, G5 allowed)** - Actually this is OKAY per X-2 rule

**FINDING:** Broken dependency reference

**Skill:** T32.G8.23 (Grade 8)
**Dependencies:**
- T32.G8.22 - OKAY
- T08.G6.01 - OKAY (G8 can depend on G6)
- **T34.G6.01 - This is a different topic entirely (T34 = ?, not T32)**

**FINDING:** Cross-topic dependency to T34 (appears to be an error or intentional cross-topic link)
**Recommendation:** Verify if T34.G6.01 dependency is intentional or error

---

## ISSUE 6: Progression Gaps

### 6.1 GAP: GK to G1 - Screen Time Balance
**GK Skills:**
- T32.GK.02: Match screen time scenarios to feeling cards

**G1 Skills:**
- T32.G1.01: Sort good vs not-so-good choices (includes pausing game)
- (No explicit screen time/balance skill)

**G2 Skills:**
- T32.G2.02: Plan balanced tech schedules
- T32.G2.06: Build a picture schedule balancing screen time

**Problem:** Jump from GK recognizing feelings to G2 planning schedules is too big
**Recommendation:** Add G1 bridging skill:
- T32.G1.XX: "Sequence picture cards showing a balanced day (screen time, play, meals, sleep)"
- Depends on T32.GK.02
- Feeds into T32.G2.02

### 6.2 GAP: Digital Footprints Introduction
**First Mention:** T32.G3.01 (Grade 3) - "Build digital footprint checker"

**Problem:** Students build a footprint checker without prior foundational understanding of what digital footprints are
**Current G2 Coverage:**
- T32.G2.04: Distinguish public vs private information (close but not same concept)

**Recommendation:** Add G2 introductory skill:
- T32.G2.XX: "Identify what information stays online (digital footprints)"
- Description: Using picture cards, students sort activities into "leaves a footprint" (posting photo, sending message, commenting) vs "doesn't leave footprint" (watching video privately, using calculator). For footprint activities, they identify what information gets saved.
- Depends on T32.G2.04
- Feeds into T32.G3.01

### 6.3 GAP: Ethics Frameworks Introduction
**First Ethics Lenses:** T32.G6.04-06 (Grade 6) - Beneficence, Fairness, Autonomy

**Prior Skill:** T32.G5.07 - "Apply simple ethics questions"

**Analysis:**
- G5.07 asks: "Does it help? Is it fair? Do users have control?"
- G6.04-06 introduce formal framework names (beneficence, fairness, autonomy)
- This progression is actually GOOD - informal questions → formal frameworks

**Status:** NO GAP - progression is appropriate

### 6.4 GAP: AI Impact Analysis
**Skills:**
- T32.G5.05: Analyze AI's differential impacts on workers and communities
- (No G4 prerequisite about AI and work)
- T32.G4.13: Ask basic AI fairness questions (but not about work/careers)

**Problem:** G5 students analyze AI workforce impacts without prior introduction to AI in workplace
**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Add T32.G4.XX: "Identify jobs that use AI tools" (bridges careers + AI awareness)
2. OR: Move T32.G5.05 to G6 and add proper prerequisites

---

## ISSUE 7: Inconsistent Terminology

### 7.1 "Team" vocabulary inconsistency
**G2-G3:** Uses "project roles" (planner, builder, tester)
**G4+:** Uses "team agreements," "team charters," "sprint reviews"

**Issue:** Sudden jump to Scrum/Agile terminology at G6 (sprint reviews) without scaffolding
**Recommendation:**
- Introduce "iteration" concept at G5 (currently has T32.G5.10a "Execute a plan-build-feedback iteration cycle")
- Rename T32.G6.23 from "Conduct sprint reviews" to "Conduct **iteration** reviews with structured feedback"
- Use "sprint" only in G7-G8 or define it explicitly

### 7.2 "Careers" vs "Jobs" terminology
**K-G4:** Uses "jobs" (T32.G1.05, T32.G2.08, T32.G4.11, T32.G4.12)
**G5+:** Uses "careers" and "pathways" (T32.G5.10, G6.14, etc.)

**Status:** This is APPROPRIATE developmental progression
**Recommendation:** No change - younger students understand "jobs," older students ready for "careers"

---

## ISSUE 8: Missing Scaffolding

### 8.1 AI Ethics Testing Scaffolding
**Current Progression:**
- G4: T32.G4.13 - Ask basic AI fairness questions
- G5: (no AI testing skills)
- G6: T32.G6.01-03 - Test AI for bias, build testing dashboard

**Problem:** Two-grade gap between asking questions and systematic testing
**Recommendation:** Add G5 scaffolding:
- T32.G5.XX: "Test AI image generation for stereotypes with simple prompts"
- Description: Students generate 5 images each for "doctor," "nurse," "scientist," "teacher" and record observed gender/race patterns in a table. They identify whether results show stereotypes and discuss why this matters.
- This bridges G4 questions → G6 systematic testing

### 8.2 Data Privacy Scaffolding
**Current Progression:**
- G3: T32.G3.04 - Build app that shows what data it collects
- G4: (no data privacy skills)
- G5: T32.G5.06 - Explain consent for AI data collection

**Problem:** One-grade gap in data privacy sequence
**Status:** ACCEPTABLE - might add G4 skill about understanding why apps collect data, but not critical

### 8.3 Collaboration Skills Scaffolding
**Current Progression:**
- G3: T32.G3.06 - Draft simple team agreements
- G4: T32.G4.09 - Track work with shared checklist
- G5: T32.G5.12 - Lead team check-in meeting
- G6: T32.G6.21 - Facilitate stand-up meetings with blocker resolution

**Status:** GOOD progression - builds from agreements → tracking → leading → facilitating

---

## ISSUE 9: Naming Inconsistencies

### 9.1 Inconsistent Use of "Build" vs "Create" vs "Design"
**Examples:**
- T32.G3.01: "**Build** digital footprint checker"
- T32.G4.02: "**Build** interactive case study viewer"
- T32.G6.12: "**Build** consent form and data collection system"
- T32.G7.06: "**Build** AI art gallery"
- T32.G8.01: "**Build** accessibility and privacy assessment modules"

**vs:**

- T32.G4.07: "**Create** a digital citizen pledge project"
- T32.G7.04: (Description says) "**Generate** and analyze AI art"

**Recommendation:** Standardize on "Build" for CreatiCode block projects to maintain consistency

### 9.2 Inconsistent Project Type Naming
**Examples:**
- "checker" (T32.G3.01 - footprint checker)
- "viewer" (T32.G4.02 - case study viewer)
- "simulator" (T32.G3.02 - recommendation simulator; T32.G7.09 - transparency simulator)
- "dashboard" (T32.G6.03 - AI testing dashboard)
- "tool" (T32.G4.05.03 - accessibility testing checklist tool)
- "system" (T32.G6.12 - data collection system)

**Recommendation:** This variety is actually OKAY - different terms describe different types of projects appropriately

---

## ISSUE 10: Sub-Skill Numbering Problems

### 10.1 T32.G4.05 Sub-Skill Structure Issue
**Current:**
- T32.G4.05: Test game for audio accessibility
- T32.G4.05.01: Test game for visual accessibility
- T32.G4.05.02: Test game for input accessibility
- T32.G4.05.03: Create accessibility testing checklist tool

**Problem:** T32.G4.05 is a peer to its sub-skills (one of three test types), not parent
**Recommendation:** Restructure as:
- T32.G4.05: Conduct accessibility testing (PARENT)
- T32.G4.05.01: Test game for audio accessibility
- T32.G4.05.02: Test game for visual accessibility
- T32.G4.05.03: Test game for input accessibility
- T32.G4.05.04: Create comprehensive accessibility testing checklist tool

OR remove parent and renumber:
- T32.G4.05a: Test game for audio accessibility
- T32.G4.05b: Test game for visual accessibility
- T32.G4.05c: Test game for input accessibility
- T32.G4.05d: Create accessibility testing checklist tool

### 10.2 T32.G4.06 Sub-Skill Structure Issue
**Current:**
- T32.G4.06: Implement keyboard controls for accessibility
- T32.G4.06.01: Add visual alternatives for audio cues
- T32.G4.06.02: Build accessibility settings menu

**Problem:** Same issue - parent is peer to children
**Recommendation:** Add true parent or renumber as a/b/c

### 10.3 T32.G8.04 Sub-Skill Structure
**Current:**
- T32.G8.04.01: Design workshop curriculum
- T32.G8.04.02: Build interactive workshop tools
- T32.G8.04.03: Deliver workshop and iterate

**Problem:** No T32.G8.04 parent skill exists
**Recommendation:** Add parent:
- T32.G8.04: Lead responsible tech workshop for younger students (PARENT)
- (Keep existing .01, .02, .03 as sub-skills)

---

## ISSUE 11: Weak Differentiation Between Adjacent Skills

### 11.1 T32.G5.01 vs T32.G5.02 vs T32.G5.03
**Skills:**
- T32.G5.01: Research technology impacts in **one community**
- T32.G5.02: Compare impacts across **two communities**
- T32.G5.03: Explain **why** technology impacts differ across contexts

**Analysis:** This is GOOD scaffolding - research → compare → explain causation
**Status:** NO ISSUE

### 11.2 T32.G6.04 vs G6.05 vs G6.06 (Ethics Lenses)
**Skills:**
- T32.G6.04: Apply beneficence lens
- T32.G6.05: Apply fairness lens
- T32.G6.06: Apply autonomy lens

**Analysis:** Each lens is distinct framework - appropriate to separate
**Status:** NO ISSUE

---

## ISSUE 12: Missing Explicit Learning Objectives

### 12.1 Clarify "Portfolio" Skills Learning Goals
**Skills:**
- T32.G6.27: Document project contributions for a portfolio
- T32.G8.14: Assemble a project portfolio
- T32.G8.15: Write a student resume

**Issue:** These are important career readiness skills but lack clear success criteria
**Recommendation:** Add explicit criteria to descriptions:
- T32.G6.27: Should specify "using active verbs" and "demonstrating both technical and soft skills"
- T32.G8.14: Should specify "showing growth over time" and "variety of project types"

---

## ISSUE 13: Topic Cross-References Need Clarification

### 13.1 T32.G5.05 References T20-T23
**Current:** "...how T20-T23 AI tools might worsen or improve equity"
**Issue:** Description references topics T20-T23 but no dependencies listed for those topics
**Recommendation:** Add note: "Students should have experience with T20-T23 AI blocks before this lesson"

### 13.2 T32.G6.10 References T22-T23
**Current:** "Develop ethics guidelines for AI perception and assistance (T22-T23)"
**Dependencies Listed:** T22.G6.01 is listed - GOOD
**Status:** NO ISSUE

### 13.3 T32.G7.07 References T20-T21
**Current:** "Conduct bias audits for AI content generation (T20-T21)"
**Issue:** Title specifies topics but no topic dependencies listed
**Recommendation:** Add dependencies to T20.G6+ and T21.G6+ or add note in description
