📈 KEY METRICS:
   - Gateway Skills: 2 (T25.G3.05 Lists, T29.G3.03 AI)
   - Capstone Skills: 9 (1 at G6, 2 at G7, 6 at G8)
   - Average Dependencies: 2.37
   - Grade Violations: 0 ✓

🎯 THE DATA SCIENCE PIPELINE:
   
   T25: Data Representation (39 skills, foundation)
     ↓
   T26: Data Collection (35 skills, gathering)
     ↓
   T27: Data Analysis (31 skills, processing)
     ↓
   T28: Experiments (31 skills, testing)  ←→  T29: Text/NLP (31 skills, AI)

🔑 CRITICAL GATEWAY: T25.G3.05 (Grade 3)
   "Build a data structure with a list"
   → Unlocks ALL structured data work in T25-T29
   → Depends on T10.G3.01 (Lists in programming)
   → Most important single skill in data domain

🚀 AI INTEGRATION HIGHLIGHTS:
   - 8 skills use T22 (Chatbots) for NLP
   - T29.G3.03 (Grade 3): First AI interaction
   - T28.G8.03: AI bias analysis (connects stats to ethics)
   - T27.G8.03: Interactive dashboard (connects data to UI)

📚 ESSENTIAL PATHWAY BY GRADE:
   K-2: Categories → Variables → Tables → Charts
   3-4: LISTS (gateway!) → Statistics → Logging → Probability
   5-6: Aggregation → Filtering → Cleaning → AI Classification
   7-8: Complete Investigations (6 major capstones)

⭐ TOP 9 CAPSTONE PROJECTS:
   G6: T26.G6.05 - Clean and prepare data
   G7: T26.G7.03 - Manipulate data with code
   G7: T28.G7.02 - Monte Carlo simulation
   G8: T26.G8.02 - Complete data investigation (7 deps)
   G8: T27.G8.01 - Data investigation
   G8: T27.G8.03 - Interactive dashboard
   G8: T28.G8.01 - Real-world experiment
   G8: T29.G8.01 - Keyword search system
   G8: T29.G8.04 - NLP ethics evaluation

💡 KEY INSIGHTS:
   1. Lists (T10) are THE critical dependency for all data work
   2. Programming core (T07, T08, T09, T10, T11) essential
   3. AI integration strongest in T29 (NLP), good in T28 (bias)
   4. Ethics present at G8, recommend earlier integration
   5. Capstones authentic: investigations, dashboards, experiments

✅ QUALITY SCORE: EXCELLENT (A)
   - Progression: Clear and systematic
   - Integration: Strong with programming core
   - Grade levels: Perfect consistency (0 violations)
   - AI bridges: Good with opportunities for enhancement
   - Ethics: Present but could be stronger

🎓 READY FOR USE IN:
   - Curriculum planning and implementation
   - Teacher professional development
   - Learning management systems
   - Assessment and evaluation design
   - Student learning pathways
