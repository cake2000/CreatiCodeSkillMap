## Pattern Analysis

### Common Pattern 1: Double G1 Dependencies
**12 skills** follow this pattern (T30, T32, T34, T35, T36):
- Depend on both **.G1.01 AND **.G1.02
- Also have transitive dependency (G1.02 already depends on G1.01)
- Need both G1 dependencies replaced AND transitive cleaned up

### Common Pattern 2: Single G1 + Transitive
**9 skills** follow this pattern (T05, T25):
- Depend on one G1 skill
- Also have transitive dependencies on kindergarten skills
- Need G1 replaced AND kindergarten transitives cleaned up

### Common Pattern 3: Single G1 Only
**4 skills** follow this pattern (T03, T12, T13):
- Only depend on a G1 skill, no transitive issues
- Simplest to fix: just replace G1 dependency

### Pattern 4: Cross-topic G2 dependency
**2 skills** (T05.G5.05, T35.G5.03):
- Depend on G2 skills from different topics (T04.G2.01)
- Need cross-topic alternative at appropriate grade
