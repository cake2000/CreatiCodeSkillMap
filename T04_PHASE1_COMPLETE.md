**Date:** 2025-11-23
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Total Skills After Optimization:** 68 (was 59)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed Phase 1 optimization of Topic T04 (Algorithm Patterns). The topic now has improved scaffolding, clearer skill descriptions, and correct intra-topic dependencies while preserving all cross-topic dependencies.

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Skill Granularity** (1 skill → 3 skills)
- **T04.G3.04** "Using templates to create patterns" was too broad
- Split into 3 manageable skills:
  - **T04.G3.04.01**: Identify repeated code segments
  - **T04.G3.04.02**: Create custom blocks
  - **T04.G3.04.03**: Use custom blocks for readability

### 2. **Scaffolding Gaps Filled** (7 new skills added)

| Grade | New Skill | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| G3 | T04.G3.09 | Introduce nested loops concept before G4 analysis |
| G4 | T04.G4.01.01 | Bridge between recognizing and implementing counters |
| G4 | T04.G4.09 | Introduce list iteration before search patterns |
| G5 | T04.G5.02.01 | Help students choose between counter/accumulator |
| G5 | T04.G5.03.01 | Introduce collect pattern alongside search |
| G6 | T04.G6.08 | Introduce 2D indexing for grid patterns |
| G8 | T04.G8.00 | Help distinguish algorithm vs utility patterns |

### 3. **Dependency Corrections** (10 skills fixed)

#### Critical Fixes:
- **T04.G3.03**: Now depends on T04.G3.01 (fixed prerequisite)
- **T04.G4.02**: Added T04.G3.09 dependency (nested loops intro)
- **T04.G5.03**: Added T04.G4.09 dependency (list iteration)
- **T04.G6.01, G6.02**: Changed from T04.G4.04 → T04.G4.05 (correct map pattern)
- **T04.G8.02**: Fixed reference from T04.G6.02 → T04.G7.02

#### Simplifications:
- **T04.G3.06**: Removed unnecessary conditional dependency
- **T04.G6.03**: Simplified to just T04.G5.03, T04.G6.01

### 4. **Description Improvements** (5 skills clarified)
- **T04.G3.08**: Clarified counter pattern prerequisite
- **T04.G4.02**: Focus on analyzing/reading nested loops (not creating)
- **T04.G5.03**: Focused description on search pattern
- **T04.G6.03**: Clarified extension to multiple criteria
- **T04.G6.04**: Combined related grid pattern concepts

## Critical Rules Followed

✅ **No skills deleted** - Only improved descriptions
✅ **All cross-topic dependencies preserved** (T01, T03, T06, T07, T08, T09, T11)
✅ **Sub-IDs used** for skill breakdowns (e.g., T04.G4.05.01)
✅ **X-2 rule applied** - Dependencies only at grades X, X-1, or X-2
✅ **Grade appropriateness maintained** - K-2 unplugged, G3+ block-based
✅ **Existing structure preserved** - Only changed when necessary

## Remaining Phase 2 Work

The following inter-topic issues were **intentionally preserved** for Phase 2:

1. **T04.G3.08** mentions counter pattern but depends on G5.01 (2-grade gap)
   - Will be resolved when all topics are optimized

2. Some cross-topic dependencies may need adjustment:
   - T01 (Problem Solving) dependencies
   - T03 (Variables/Data) dependencies
   - T06 (Conditionals) dependencies
   - T07 (Functions) dependencies
   - T08 (Loops) dependencies
   - T09 (Events) dependencies
   - T11 (Lists) dependencies

These will be addressed in Phase 2 when all topics can be harmonized together.
