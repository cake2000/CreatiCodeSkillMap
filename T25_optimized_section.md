Skill: Understand Third Normal Form (3NF)
Description: Students learn that Third Normal Form eliminates transitive dependencies where non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes. They examine tables where one field determines another (e.g., cityName determines stateCode) and extract these into separate lookup tables. Students practice identifying transitive dependencies.
