# T01 – Everyday Algorithms & Step‑by‑Step Thinking: K–8 Skill List (v4, High‑Granularity IXL‑Style)

Topic reference: `T01 Everyday Algorithms & Step‑by‑Step Thinking` in `domains_topics_overview.md`  
Domain: Algorithms & Design (D1) · Primary CSTA focus: ALG‑AF, with links to ALG‑PS, ALG‑IM, PRO‑PF, PRO‑TR

This v4 version makes T01 **more IXL‑like** by:

- Increasing to **~10 finely scoped skills per grade** (≈85 total for T01).
- Designing **short, enjoyable tasks** with one clear objective each.
- Organizing skills into **strands per grade** (sequence basics, choices, repetition, quality/efficiency, fairness, etc.).
- Keeping skills:
  - **Developmentally appropriate** (K–2 picture‑based per `docs/K2_QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`),
  - **Auto‑gradable** in CreatiCode (block structure + runtime checks),
  - **Aligned** with CSTA Draft 2.0 (`docs/CSTA_STANDARDS_REFERENCE.md`).

IDs follow the pattern `T01.G<grade>.<nn>`. Many v3 skills appear here (sometimes refined) and are surrounded by additional micro‑skills for smoother progressions.

## Implementation Notes

- This v4 spec is designed for **high density and smooth difficulty curves**, similar in spirit to IXL’s topic breakdowns:
  - Each skill is an **atomic idea**: one representation, one role (read/write/debug/apply), one difficulty step.
  - Many core ideas appear in multiple roles (e.g., “repeat” in concept, tracing, debugging), building robust mastery.
- For production:
  - Use this file as the **design source** for expanding `skills_k8_ai_complete_FINAL.json` and dependencies.
  - Within each grade, earlier IDs (lower `.<nn>`) should generally be prerequisites for later ones in the same strand.
  - Cross‑topic dependencies (e.g., to T06–T09) follow the same philosophy as in v2/v3, but individual skills can now target more specific prerequisite sets.
