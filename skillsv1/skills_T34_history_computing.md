## Alignment Notes

**Overall CSTA Alignment:** All skills in T34 align with the **CAS-HC (History of Computing)** subtopic under **Computing and Society (CAS)**. Some skills also touch **CAS-ET (Emerging Technologies)** and **CAS-CE (Career Exploration)** subtopics as indicated. The progression moves from simple recognition of modern technologies (K) through exploration of diverse contributors (Grades 1–2), research-based understanding (Grades 3–5), comparative analysis (Grades 6–7), and critical examination of policies and future trends (Grade 8).

**K–2 Focus:** Concrete, narrative-based understanding; building awareness of computing in daily life and introduction to diverse historical figures.

**Grades 3–5 Focus:** Local research and community impact; understanding technology as response to need; examining positive and negative effects.

**Grades 6–8 Focus:** Systemic and policy-level analysis; comparative and critical thinking; connection of historical practices to modern ethical concerns; forward-looking speculation.

**Diverse Pioneer Integration:** Throughout all grades, content emphasizes contributions from women, people of color, and non-Western computing pioneers, deliberately countering narrow historical narratives often centered on a few white men. Examples include Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Hedy Lamarr, Katherine Johnson, Alan Turing, Euclid Lantern, and many others.

**CreatiCode Alignment:** While T34 is primarily concept-heavy, challenges can be embedded in CreatiCode projects by:
- Using CreatiCode to research and document findings (text and multimedia).
- Creating interactive timelines or decision trees in CreatiCode showing computing history.
- Building presentations or simulations of computing concepts in CreatiCode.
- Using CreatiCode's AI or multimedia features to explore historical scenarios or implications.

Auto-grading relies on rubrics, keyword/concept matching for open responses, and code/project artifact inspection where applicable.
