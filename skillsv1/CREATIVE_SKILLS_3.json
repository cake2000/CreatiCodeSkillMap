    "description": "Students design a complete visual theme for their project by choosing a 3-5 color palette based on the emotion or mood they want to convey (energetic, calm, mysterious, playful). They learn basic color theory (complementary colors, analogous colors, warm vs. cool) and select typography that matches their theme (playful fonts for a kids' game, serious fonts for an educational app, modern vs. retro). Students create a style guide document showing their colors (with hex codes), fonts, and visual elements, then apply this consistent visual theme across all sprites, backgrounds, and UI elements in their project.",
    "description_teacher": "This skill teaches fundamental design principles through hands-on application. Students make intentional aesthetic choices rather than random styling. They learn that design decisions should be driven by purpose (what emotion do I want to create?) and consistency (use the same palette throughout). This bridges art and programming, showing that coding projects are also creative design work. Encourage students to look at professional apps/games for inspiration and to articulate why they chose specific colors and fonts.",
