## Grade K (PreK–K)

Kindergarten focuses on recognizing that computers connect to each other and the internet, and that devices communicate to share information in simple, concrete ways.

### T31.GK.01 – Computers can talk to each other

- **Short name:** Devices share information
- **Description:** Students recognize that computers and devices are connected and can send messages or information to each other. They understand this in concrete, observable terms (e.g., "my tablet talks to the internet to show videos").
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice with pictures. Show 3–4 scenarios of device use (e.g., watching a video, playing an online game, video call with a family member). Students select which ones involve devices talking to each other. Auto‑grading checks selected items.
- **CSTA:** EK‑SAS‑NW‑01 (implied: recognizing connectivity).

### T31.GK.02 – The internet connects people

- **Short name:** Internet connects distant people
- **Description:** Students understand that the internet allows people in different places to communicate and share. They can identify simple examples from their own lives (video calls, online games with friends far away).
- **Challenge format:** Concept, open-ended drawing or matching. Students draw or match pictures showing how the internet helps people connect (e.g., a child talking to a grandparent across the country). Discussion/narration explains the connection.
- **CSTA:** EK‑SAS‑IM‑03 (impacts of computing).

### T31.GK.03 – Information travels (not visible)

- **Short name:** Messages travel through the air/wires
- **Description:** Students learn that information sent over the internet travels through wires or air (wireless signals) to reach its destination, even though we don't see it. A simple mental model: information is like mail traveling in pipes.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, unplugged activity or interactive. A CreatiCode demo shows a sprite sending a message that travels (visual animation) to another sprite. Students observe and describe where messages go.
- **CSTA:** EK‑SAS‑NW‑01 (understanding device connectivity).

- **CSTA:** E1‑SAS‑NW‑01 (implied: understanding message sending).

### T31.G1.02 – Cloud storage saves your work

- **Short name:** Online storage keeps your files safe

Grade 2 deepens understanding of packets, basic network concepts, and introduces simple cloud variable use in CreatiCode.

### T31.G2.01 – Break a message into packets

- **Short name:** Messages are sent in pieces
- **Description:** Students learn that long messages (like a video or email) are broken into smaller pieces called packets before traveling over the internet. Each packet travels separately and is reassembled at the destination, like a puzzle being mailed in pieces.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, hands-on or simulation. Use a simple unplugged activity: write a message, cut it into pieces (packets), shuffle them, and reassemble. Or use a CreatiCode simulation showing packets traveling on a network. Students describe why breaking a message into packets might be useful.
- **CSTA:** E2‑SAS‑NW‑02 (understanding packet transmission).

### T31.G2.02 – Data travels on the Internet

- **CSTA:** E2‑SAS‑NW‑03 (basic network understanding).

### T31.G2.03 – Recognize client and server roles

- **Short name:** A server stores; a client asks
- **Description:** Students learn that the internet uses a client-server model: your device (the client) asks for information from a distant computer (the server). The server stores the information and sends it back. Examples: asking a website for a webpage, or asking a game server for your saved progress.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice or scenario matching. Show scenarios (e.g., "You ask for a video from YouTube") and label which is the client and which is the server. Auto‑grading checks labels.

### T31.G4.01 – Synchronize data between players

- **Short name:** Both players see the same thing
- **Description:** Students understand that in multiplayer games, the game needs to send each player's position or actions to all other players so everyone sees the same game state. This is data synchronization.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, observation and explanation. Play a simple 2-player CreatiCode game where students see both their own sprite and a partner's sprite move. Students explain why they can see both. Auto‑grading checks explanation quality.
- **CSTA:** E4‑DAA‑DP‑01 (data processing and sharing).

Students enter parameters and connect. A judge verifies both players are in the same game session. Auto‑grading checks successful join.
- **CSTA:** E4‑PRO‑PD‑01.

### T31.G4.03 – Broadcast a message to all multiplayer players

- **Short name:** Send a message to all players
- **Description:** Students use a broadcast block in CreatiCode multiplayer to send a message that all players in the game receive. This might trigger a shared action (e.g., all sprites jump, or a shared sprite appears).
- **Challenge format:** Coding, starter project with multiplayer setup. Prompt: "When you press a key, broadcast a message 'jump' so all players see a sprite jump." Students add the broadcast block. Auto‑grading verifies the broadcast occurs and all players receive it.

- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding. Show two versions of a multiplayer game: one without waits (positions desync) and one with waits (synced). Students identify why one works better. Then students modify a starter project to add a wait block before checking for updates. Auto‑grading verifies the wait block is present and timed appropriately.
- **CSTA:** E5‑PRO‑PD‑01.

### T31.G5.03 – Understand cloud data storage for apps

- **Challenge format:** Coding, starter project. Provided: a game with a score variable and a cloud block. Prompt: "Save the player's score to the cloud so it persists even after closing the app." Students create cloud variables and save/load logic. Auto‑grading closes and reopens the project to verify data persists.

- **Challenge format:** Concept, explanation and analysis. Present a scenario: "In a fast multiplayer game, Player 1 shoots but Player 2 doesn't see it for 0.5 seconds. How could this be unfair?" Students explain fairness concerns and suggest solutions. Auto‑grading uses rubric for explanation quality.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑11 (impacts of computing systems).

### T31.G6.04 – Evaluate privacy in shared online data

- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding. Provide a scenario: "In your multiplayer racing game, what data must each player send to others each frame?" Students write a protocol (as a table or JSON-like format) and implement it in CreatiCode using variables and messages. Auto‑grading checks completeness and that the protocol correctly syncs state.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PD‑07, MS‑DAA‑DF‑02.

### T31.G7.03 – Evaluate network topology and efficiency

- **Challenge format:** Concept, analysis. Show diagrams of different topologies with 4 players. Students evaluate trade-offs: "In a star network, the server is a bottleneck. In a mesh, each player connects to all others. Which is better for a real-time game?" Auto‑grading uses rubric for reasoning.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑NW‑04.

### T31.G7.04 – Analyze the impact of networked systems on society

- **Challenge format:** Concept, simulation and tracing. Use an interactive tool or CreatiCode simulation showing packets being routed through a network. Students identify IP addresses, hops (routers), and packet reassembly. Auto‑grading checks understanding of routing concepts.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑NW‑05.

### T31.G8.02 – Design a secure multiplayer system

- **Short name:** Protect multiplayer games from attacks

- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑SC‑08, MS‑SAS‑SC‑10.

### T31.G8.03 – Implement data encryption for privacy

- **Short name:** Encrypt data for protection

- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding. Provide a simple substitution or XOR cipher block in CreatiCode (or unplugged). Prompt: "Encrypt a message before sending it over the network so only the receiver can read it." Students implement basic encryption/decryption. Auto‑grading checks that encrypted data is unreadable and decryption works.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑SC‑09.

### T31.G8.04 – Evaluate resilience and redundancy in networks

- **Short name:** How the internet stays up
- **Description:** Students learn that the internet is designed with redundancy: multiple paths for data, backup servers, and distributed architecture so that if one part fails, data can still be routed elsewhere.
