## Corrected Recommendations

### FINDING 1: Conceptual Coverage is Excellent
The skill map has **outstanding coverage** of computational thinking concepts. Events, loops, conditionals, variables, lists, and functions are taught systematically across 3 grade levels.

### FINDING 2: Block Usage is Assumed, Not Taught
Most skills assume students already know how to:
- Move sprites
- Change appearance
- Play sounds
- Detect collisions
- Use the pen

### FINDING 3: T01.G3.01 is the Foundation
The single skill `T01.G3.01` is currently carrying the burden of teaching basic block usage. Its description mentions:
- "move 10 steps"
- "turn 90 degrees"
- "say 'Done!'"

This ONE skill introduces motion and looks blocks, but doesn't provide depth.

### FINDING 4: Grades 1-2 Provide Limited Block Introduction
**Grade 2 has one skill:**
- `T06.G2.04`: Button Makes Sprite Move (picture-based matching activity, not coding)

**Grade 1 has:**
- No explicit block-coding skills (picture-based only)

### FINDING 5: Gap is Real but Smaller Than Expected
The earlier analysis was correct that foundational block skills are missing, but the gap is:
- **NOT** a complete absence of foundation (T01.G3.01 exists)
- **NOT** missing all computational concepts (these are well-covered)
- **IS** missing systematic teaching of CreatiCode block categories
- **IS** assuming students learn blocks through project context

---

## What ACTUALLY Needs to Be Created

### Recommendation: Create "Block Introduction" Skills for Grade 2-3

**New Topic Suggestion: "T37: CreatiCode Block Basics"** (or integrate into T01)

**Grade 2 Skills (6-8 new skills):**
1. Move and Turn Basics
2. Say and Think Bubbles
3. Play a Sound
4. Switch Costumes
5. Show and Hide
6. Change Size
7. Detect Clicks and Keys (expand on T06.G2.04)
8. Touch a Color or Sprite

**Grade 3 Additions (10-12 new skills):**
1. Glide to Position
2. Go to Location
3. Point in Direction
4. Change X and Y Position
5. Graphic Effects (color, ghost)
6. Layer Ordering
7. Volume and Tempo
8. Mouse Position
9. Ask and Answer
10. Distance Sensing
11. Pen Down and Stamp
12. Clear the Stage

**Integration Strategy:**
- Keep T01.G3.01 as the "first algorithm" skill
- Add T37 as prerequisite to T01.G3.01
- Make T37 skills dependencies for project-based topics (T14-T20)

---

## Conclusion

### ACCURATE PICTURE:

**What EXISTS:**
- ✅ 447 Grade 3-5 skills
- ✅ Excellent computational thinking coverage
- ✅ Strong concepts: Events, Loops, Conditionals, Variables, Lists, Functions
- ✅ Rich project-based learning (games, animation, 3D, AI, data)
- ⚠️ ONE foundational block skill (T01.G3.01) teaching move/turn/say

**What's MISSING:**
- ❌ Systematic teaching of Motion block variants (5-6 skills needed)
- ❌ Complete Looks block instruction (6-8 skills needed)
- ❌ Foundational Sound block skills (3-4 skills needed)
- ❌ Comprehensive Sensing block skills (5-6 skills needed)
- ❌ Pen/Drawing blocks (4-5 skills needed, if desired)

**Total Gap:** 23-29 new foundational block skills recommended for Grades 2-3

### VERIFICATION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

The earlier analysis was correct in identifying a gap in foundational block instruction, but the gap is:
- **Narrower** than feared (concepts are excellent)
- **Deeper** in specific areas (motion, looks, sound, sensing)
- **Fixable** with 23-29 targeted skills

The existing skill map is **production-ready** for conceptual learning but would benefit from a "Block Basics" module to ensure all students can use CreatiCode blocks confidently before tackling project-based skills.
