## X-2 Rule Compliance Analysis

### Definition
The X-2 rule states that a Grade X skill should not depend on skills from Grade (X-3) or earlier:
- Grade 3+ skills cannot have Kindergarten dependencies
- Grade 4+ skills cannot have Grade 1 dependencies
- Grade 5+ skills cannot have Grade 2 dependencies

### Results
**✅ PERFECT COMPLIANCE - 0 violations found**

All T03 dependencies follow proper grade progression. Even cross-topic dependencies respect the X-2 rule.

---

## Cross-Topic Dependencies Analysis

T03 skills have dependencies on the following other topics:

### T01 (Sequencing) - 1 dependency
- **T03.GK.03** → T01.GK.01 (Put pictures in order for getting ready for bed)
  - **Status:** ✅ Valid - Kindergarten to Kindergarten

### T02 (Algorithms & Flowcharts) - 2 dependencies
- **T03.G5.02** → T02.G4.01 (Add a loop to an existing flowchart)
  - **Status:** ✅ Valid - Grade 5 to Grade 4
- **T03.G7.01** → T02.G3.01 (Identify start, action, and end symbols in flowcharts)
  - **Status:** ✅ Valid - Grade 7 to Grade 3

### T04 (Algorithm Patterns) - 1 dependency
- **T03.G7.01** → T04.G5.01 (Identify the repeating unit in a longer pattern)
  - **Status:** ✅ Valid - Grade 7 to Grade 5

### T06 (Events) - 8 dependencies
Multiple skills depend on T06.G3.01 (Build a green‑flag script):
- T03.G3.01, T03.G4.01, T03.G5.01, T03.G6.01, T03.G6.02, T03.G7.02, T03.G7.04
- **Status:** ✅ Valid - All are Grade 3+ depending on Grade 3

One skill depends on T06.G6.01:
- T03.G8.05 → T06.G6.01 (Trace event execution paths)
  - **Status:** ✅ Valid - Grade 8 to Grade 6

### T08 (Conditionals) - 1 dependency
- **T03.G4.01** → T08.G3.01 (Use a simple if in a script)
  - **Status:** ✅ Valid - Grade 4 to Grade 3

### T09 (Variables) - 5 dependencies
- **T03.G3.06** → T09.G3.02 (Use a variable in a conditional)
  - **Status:** ✅ Valid - Grade 3 to Grade 3
- Multiple skills → T09.G3.01.04 (Display variable value on stage):
  - T03.G4.01, T03.G6.01, T03.G7.02, T03.G7.04
  - **Status:** ✅ Valid - All are Grade 4+ depending on Grade 3

**All cross-topic dependencies are logical and appropriate.**

---

## Circular Dependency Check

**✅ NO CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES DETECTED**

The dependency graph forms a proper directed acyclic graph (DAG) with clear progression from earlier to later skills.

---

## Dependency Progression Patterns

### Internal T03 Progression
The T03 skills follow a clear hierarchical progression:
1. **GK-G1:** Basic part-whole relationships and simple steps
2. **G2:** Subtasks and grouping
3. **G3:** Features, prioritization, and planning
4. **G4:** Components, modules, and team organization
5. **G5:** Comprehensive breakdowns and dependencies
6. **G6:** Modules, reusability, and milestones
7. **G7:** Architecture diagrams and decomposition evaluation
8. **G8:** Formal specifications and refactoring

### Cross-Topic Integration
T03 integrates appropriately with:
- **T01 (Sequencing):** Foundation for ordering steps
- **T02 (Algorithms):** Visual representation tools
- **T04 (Patterns):** Pattern recognition in architecture
- **T06 (Events):** Practical implementation context
- **T07 (Loops):** Implementation knowledge
- **T08 (Conditionals):** Implementation knowledge
- **T09 (Variables):** Data management context
