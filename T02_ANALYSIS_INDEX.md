## SUMMARY OF ISSUES FOUND

### Critical Issues (need immediate attention):

1. **Numbering inconsistencies:**
   - T02.G4.08 comes after T02.G4.10 (should be sequential)
   - T02.G5.07 and T02.G5.08 out of sequence
   - T02.G7.07 comes before T02.G7.04 but G7.04 depends on G7.07

2. **Dependency circular reference:**
   - T02.G7.04 depends on T02.G7.07, but G7.07 should logically come after G7.04 based on numbering

### Moderate Issues (recommend addressing):

3. **Potential dependency mismatches:**
   - T02.G4.03 (I/O symbols) depends on T02.G4.02 (loops), but seems independent of loops

4. **Clarity needed:**
   - T02.G2.03: "move/say icons" - clarify if this is coding or unplugged
   - T02.G3.06: "script" - clarify block code vs text code
   - T02.G7.01: "trace code" - shift from flowcharts to code?

### Minor Issues (nice to have):

5. **Potential gaps:**
   - T02.G4.01 introduces loops in flowcharts with no prior T02 loop exposure (though students may have loop knowledge from T01 or other topics)

6. **Potential redundancy:**
   - T02.G2.02 and T02.G2.05 seem very similar

### Positive Observations:

- ✓ K-2 skills are appropriately unplugged/picture-based
- ✓ Grade 3+ transitions to coding tools (Diagrams tab)
- ✓ Good progression from recognition → creation → tracing → debugging
- ✓ Trace tables introduced systematically (concept → practice → complex)
- ✓ Pseudocode introduced gradually (simple → structured → complex)
- ✓ Good connection between flowcharts, pseudocode, and code
- ✓ Algorithm comparison/efficiency concepts introduced appropriately
- ✓ Real-world applications and user-centered design in Grade 8
- ✓ Most dependencies follow the X-2 rule (no skill depends on something more than 2 grades ahead)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority:

1. **Fix numbering:**
   - Renumber T02.G4.08 → T02.G4.11 (or swap with G4.09)
   - Renumber T02.G5.07 → T02.G5.03
   - Renumber T02.G5.08 → T02.G5.04
   - Renumber subsequent skills accordingly
   - Fix G7.04 and G7.07 sequence

2. **Fix circular dependency:**
   - Either swap G7.04 and G7.07 numbers, or change the dependency

### Medium Priority:

3. **Review dependencies:**
   - T02.G4.03: Consider depending on T02.G3.02 instead of T02.G4.02

4. **Add clarifications:**
   - Specify unplugged vs coding tools in descriptions where ambiguous
   - Define "script" terminology consistently

### Low Priority:

5. **Consider merging:**
   - Review T02.G2.02 and T02.G2.05 for potential consolidation

6. **Add bridging skill:**
   - Consider adding a skill in T01 or T07 about loops before T02.G4.01, or add explicit note about prerequisite knowledge

## DEPENDENCY CHECK (X-2 Rule)

All T02 internal dependencies were checked. No violations of the X-2 rule were found within T02 skills.

**Cross-topic dependencies:** All dependencies on T01, T03, T07 topics are preserved and not flagged as issues per instructions.

---

## CONCLUSION

The T02 topic is well-structured overall with a clear progression from picture-based algorithms (K-2) to flowcharts (3+) to pseudocode (4+) to algorithm analysis (5-8). The main issues are numbering inconsistencies and one circular dependency that need correction. The skills are generally clear, actionable, and grade-appropriate.
