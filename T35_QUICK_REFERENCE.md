## Key Improvements

### 1. Focus
- Each skill now addresses ONE clear concept
- No more "build + test + analyze + propose" mega-skills

### 2. Scaffolding
- G5.05 bridges G5 analysis to G6 ethics frameworks
- G5.06 teaches source evaluation before research projects
- Sequential breakdowns ensure step-by-step progression

### 3. Completeness
- Added critical media literacy skills (source credibility, deepfakes)
- Comprehensive AI ethics coverage (T21-T24)
- No gaps in progression

### 4. Dependencies
- Fixed X-2 rule violation (G5 → G3)
- All breakdowns have proper sequential dependencies
- All cross-topic dependencies preserved

### 5. Clarity
- Concrete materials specified (picture cards, widgets, timers)
- Specific actions described (sort, categorize, build, analyze)
- Assessment methods clear (checklists, rubrics, table variables)
