- This 3-topic arc creates natural ethics progression
- Culminates in T36.G8.01 (K-8 capstone)

### The "Unique Characteristic"
57.9% of T30-T36 skills have cross-domain dependencies
- Well-integrated with all prior domains
- Lighter on programming (appropriate for systems/ethics focus)
- Strong connections to T05 (design), T21-T24 (AI), T35 (impacts)

### The "Dependencies to Know"
- **T33 ← T06** (26 connections): APIs require programming
- **T32 ← T09** (15 connections): Variables for passwords
- **T35 ← T14-T24** (multiple): Applications inform impacts
