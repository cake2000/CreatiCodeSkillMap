## Grade 3 (14 skills)

ID: T13.G3.01.01
Topic: T13 – 2D Games
Skill: Program horizontal movement with arrow keys
Description: Build sprite movement using `when [left arrow] key pressed` with `change x by (-10)` for left, and `when [right arrow] key pressed` with `change x by (10)` for right. **How it works:** Each key press triggers the change-by block once, moving sprite 10 pixels. Holding the key triggers repeated events (automatic repeat). **Test your code:** Verify sprite moves equal distances left and right, responds immediately to key presses. **Debug tips:** If sprite only moves once per key press, ensure you're holding the key. If sprite moves wrong direction, check positive/negative values (negative x = left, positive x = right). _CSTA: 2-AP-10._

Dependencies:
* T13.G2.04: Sequence picture cards showing a safe path through a level
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence


ID: T13.G3.01.02
Topic: T13 – 2D Games
Skill: Program 4-directional movement with arrow keys
Description: Extend horizontal movement by adding vertical controls: `when [up arrow] key pressed` with `change y by (10)` and `when [down arrow] key pressed` with `change y by (-10)`. **Coordinate system:** Positive y = up (toward top of screen), negative y = down (toward bottom). **Test your code:** Press each arrow key to verify all four directions work correctly. Test diagonal movement by pressing two keys simultaneously (up + right should move diagonally). **Total setup:** 4 separate `when key pressed` scripts, one for each arrow key. This 4-directional control is standard for top-down games like maze or exploration games. _CSTA: 2-AP-10._

Dependencies:
* T13.G3.01.01: Program horizontal movement with arrow keys
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence


ID: T13.G3.01.03
Topic: T13 – 2D Games
Skill: Debug and tune movement speed
Description: Test different step values in `change x by` and `change y by` blocks to find the right movement speed for your game. **Experiment:** Try values 5, 10, 15, 20 and observe the difference. **Game type guidelines:** Maze games → slower (5-8 steps) for precise navigation; Action games → faster (10-15 steps) for responsive feel; Racing games → very fast (15-25 steps). **Debug scenario:** Movement feels sluggish → increase step value; Player overshoots targets → decrease step value. **Testing process:** Change value, play test, observe, adjust, repeat until movement feels right. This iterative tuning is essential game design skill. _CSTA: 2-AP-17._

Dependencies:
* T13.G3.01.02: Program 4-directional movement with arrow keys


ID: T13.G3.02
Topic: T13 – 2D Games
Skill: Constrain sprite within screen boundaries
Description: Add boundary checking to prevent sprite from leaving the visible stage area. **Stage boundaries:** x ranges from -240 (left edge) to 240 (right edge), y ranges from -180 (bottom) to 180 (top). **Implementation:** Inside a `forever` loop, add 4 if-statements: `if <(x position) < (-240)> then [set x to (-240)]`, `if <(x position) > (240)> then [set x to (240)]`, same pattern for y with -180/180. **Why forever loop:** Boundary checks must run continuously, not just during movement, to catch any position changes. **Test your code:** Move sprite to each edge and verify it stops exactly at boundary without going off-screen. _CSTA: 2-AP-13._

* T13.G3.01.02: Program 4-directional movement with arrow keys

Topic: T13 – 2D Games
Skill: Detect collision with goal sprite
Description: Use `if <touching [Goal]?> then` block inside a `forever` loop to continuously check if player reaches the goal. **How collision detection works:** The `touching?` block returns true when any part of player sprite's visible pixels overlap with any part of Goal sprite's visible pixels. **Implementation:** `forever { if <touching [Goal]?> then { say [You Win!] for (2) seconds } }`. **Test your code:** Move player to touch goal from different directions (left, right, above, below) to verify detection works from all angles. **Common issue:** If goal has transparent pixels in costume, collision only triggers on visible parts. _CSTA: 2-AP-13._
