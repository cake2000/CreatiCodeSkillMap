Description: Students implement voice control using CreatiCode's speech recognition pattern: (1) "start recognizing speech in [English]" begins listening, (2) Store recognized text in a variable when recognition completes, (3) Check the variable value to trigger actions: if recognized text = "jump" → make sprite jump, if recognized text = "stop" → stop all motion. Students handle: enabling microphone permissions, setting language, and checking for empty/unrecognized results. **Pattern:** Start recognition → wait for result → check text → perform action. _Auto-graded: Speech recognition started + result checked + at least 2 different voice commands handled.

Description: Students use "when timer equals [X]" or "when timer > [X]" events to trigger actions at specific times. **Example 1:** Power-up expires after 10 seconds: "when timer > 10" → remove power-up effect → reset timer. **Example 2:** Countdown warning: "when timer = 5" → play warning sound → say "5 seconds left!". Students reset the timer in green flag script and observe that the event fires at the specified time. Compare to using "wait" blocks which block other code. _Auto-graded: Timer event triggers at correct time + timer is reset properly. CSTA: E5-PRO-PF-01._

ID: T06.G6.23
Topic: T06 – Events & Sequences
Skill: Build "when variable changed" event for reactive data displays
Description: Students use "when variable [score] changed" event to automatically update UI when data changes: score changes → update score display sprite size/text, health changes → update health bar width. **Key benefit:** No need to manually call update functions after every score change; the event fires automatically whenever ANY code changes the variable. Students compare: (A) Manual approach - add "broadcast update-display" after every "change score by" block, (B) Reactive approach - single "when variable changed" event handles all cases. Students implement reactive health bar that resizes automatically when health changes from any source (enemy hit, healing item, time damage). _Auto-graded: Variable-changed event updates display; display reflects changes from multiple sources.

Topic: T06 – Events & Sequences
Skill: Build periodic event triggers using timer reset patterns
Description: Students create events that fire repeatedly at intervals by resetting the timer. **Pattern:** "when timer > 2" → spawn enemy → reset timer (creates enemy every 2 seconds). **Example game:** Asteroids spawn every 3 seconds, power-ups spawn every 15 seconds.

Topic: T06 – Events & Sequences
Skill: Implement event throttling pattern for performance
Description: Students implement throttling to limit how often an event handler runs: store lastRunTime variable, in handler check "if timer - lastRunTime > 0.1 then run logic and update lastRunTime". Apply to mouse move events (prevent 60 updates/second) or collision checks. Compare performance with and without throttling using frame rate display. **Difference from debouncing (G8):** Throttling ensures regular execution at max rate (e.g., every 100ms), while debouncing waits until activity stops. _Auto-graded: Throttling implemented + performance comparison documented. CSTA: E7-PRO-PF-01._

Description: Students use CreatiCode's `break` block to exit a loop immediately when a condition is met. Example: `for i from 1 to 100 [if (item i of list = target) [set found to i, break]]` - stops as soon as target is found instead of checking all 100 items.

Description: Students use CreatiCode's `for each item [name] in [myList]` block to process each list item by value. Example: `for each item score in highScores [say score]` - the variable `score` takes each value (85, 92, 78...) in turn. Use for-each item when you care about VALUES, not positions. Cleaner than: `for i from 1 to (length of list) [set item to (item i of list)]`.

Students balance efficiency with API constraints.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Analyze loop complexity (O(n), O(n²), O(log n))
Description: Students analyze loop structures to determine Big-O complexity. **Single loop** over n items: O(n). **Nested loops** (for i to n [for j to n]): O(n²). **Binary search** halving each time: O(log n). **Task:** Given code, identify the complexity and explain how doubling n affects runtime. Example: nested loop with n=100 runs 10,000 times; with n=200 runs 40,000 times (4× slower, not 2×). Students predict performance for large inputs and choose appropriate algorithms.

Skill: Process streaming AI responses with loops
Description: Students use loops to process streaming responses from ChatGPT in real-time. **Pattern using CreatiCode:** Configure ChatGPT block with streaming=true, then use `repeat until <chatGPT streaming done?> [set chunk to (chatGPT streaming text), append chunk to display, wait 0.05 seconds]`. **Key insight:** Streaming mode returns partial responses incrementally rather than waiting for completion. **Applications:** Display AI responses as they're generated (like typing effect), process long responses progressively, provide responsive user feedback. Students understand the difference between batch and stream processing patterns.

Dependencies:
* T07.G8.08: Design loops for batch AI API calls

ID: T07.G8.11
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Implement selection sort and compare to bubble sort
Description: Students implement selection sort and compare its performance to bubble sort. **Algorithm:** Find minimum in unsorted portion, swap to front, repeat. **Pattern:** `for i from 1 to (length-1) [set minIndex to i, for j from (i+1) to length [if (item j < item minIndex) [set minIndex to j]], swap items at i and minIndex]`. **Comparison:** Both are O(n²), but selection sort does fewer swaps (n vs up to n²). Students trace both algorithms on the same data and count operations. **Key insight:** Different algorithms with same complexity can have different practical performance.

Topic: T08 – Conditions & Logic
Skill: Use "wait until" block to pause until condition is true
Description: **Student task:** Use CreatiCode's "wait until <condition>" block to make a sprite pause until something specific happens. For example, "wait until <touching goal>" before saying "You win!", or "wait until <answer = 'yes'>" before continuing a quiz. Students build programs where timing depends on game state rather than fixed delays. This introduces event-driven synchronization patterns essential for responsive games and interactive stories.

ID: T08.G3.09
Topic: T08 – Conditions & Logic
Skill: Distinguish between "if" (check once) vs "forever if" (continuous checking)
Description: **Student task:** Compare two programs: one with a single "if" block that checks once, and another with "if" inside a "forever" loop that checks continuously. Given a scenario (e.g., "sprite should react whenever it touches the wall, not just once"), choose which pattern to use and explain why. Students trace both patterns to understand that "if" alone checks once at that moment, while "forever if" continuously monitors. This prevents a common beginner mistake of expecting single if-blocks to keep checking.

Skill: Debug simple AND/OR condition errors
Description: **Student task:** Find and fix a bug where AND was used instead of OR (or vice versa). For example, a game ends when "score = 0 AND lives = 0" but should end when "score = 0 OR lives = 0". Students trace through the condition with test values to identify the logical error. This bridges simple comparison debugging (G3.05) to compound logic debugging (G4.08).

Topic: T08 – Conditions & Logic
Skill: Trace code with a sequence of if/else blocks
Description: **Student task:** Trace code with 2-3 sequential if/else blocks and predict the final output for given variable values. Track how each if/else affects program state before the next one evaluates. For example, trace: "if x>5 then set y to 1, if y=1 then say 'yes'" with x=6. Record intermediate state changes between conditionals. This develops sequential reasoning through multiple decision points.

ID: T08.G4.10
Topic: T08 – Conditions & Logic
Skill: Use "continue" block to skip loop iteration based on condition
Description: **Student task:** In CreatiCode, use the "continue" block inside a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration when a condition is met. For example, in a repeat loop processing a list: "if <item = 'skip'> then continue" to skip certain items. Students build programs that process collections selectively, like skipping blank entries or filtering out invalid data. This pattern is fundamental for efficient data processing and game logic where not every item needs the same treatment.

Topic: T08 – Conditions & Logic
Skill: Use condition-triggered events to respond to state changes
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `when <condition>` hat block (event_whenboolean) to trigger scripts when a boolean condition becomes true.

For example: a broadcast handler checks a variable before another handler has set it, or collision detection happens before position updates. Students use strategies like adding wait blocks, reordering broadcasts, or using flags to synchronize event handlers. This addresses race conditions that occur when multiple scripts run concurrently, a common source of hard-to-find bugs in complex interactive projects.

Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Create, initialize, and increment a variable
Description: Students create their first variable in the block editor by choosing "Make a Variable" with a descriptive name (e.g., "score", "lives"), immediately initialize it with "set [variable] to (value)" at program start, and use "change [variable] by (1)" to increase it by 1 when events occur. They understand that (1) variable names should describe what they store, (2) variables need starting values, and (3) "change by" adds to the current value. This consolidates basic variable creation, initialization, and the increment-by-1 pattern.

ID: T09.G3.03
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Use variable reporter blocks in other blocks

* T08.G3.02: Decide when a single if is enough




ID: T09.G3.04
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions

Description: Students write conditionals that read a variable's value using simple comparisons (e.g., "if score > 3 then say 'Great!'", "if lives < 1 then say 'Game Over'"). This explicitly connects the variable concept to conditional logic with small, easy-to-test numbers. Focus on understanding that variables can be checked in conditions to control program behavior.

Dependencies:

ID: T09.G3.05
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Debug missing initialization and wrong update values
Description: Students inspect simple scripts (3-5 blocks) where variables don't work because they weren't initialized OR update by the wrong amount. They recognize symptoms (variable starts with wrong value, or changes incorrectly) and find the missing "set [variable] to [initial value]" block or wrong number in "change by [amount]" blocks. This consolidates the two most common beginner variable bugs: missing initialization and wrong literal values.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.04: Use a variable in a simple conditional (if block)




ID: T09.G3.06
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Debug missing change/update block
Description: Students inspect simple scripts (3-5 blocks) where a variable doesn't update as expected during gameplay.

This builds pattern recognition for update-related bugs.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.05: Debug missing initialization and wrong update values




ID: T09.G3.07
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Trace code with variables to predict outcomes
Description: Students trace a very short script (3-4 steps) where a variable changes in simple ways (set to 0, change by 1, change by 1 again), and predict the final value by reading and following the code. This skill focuses on understanding existing code and predicting outcomes, not creating new variables. Use small numbers and obvious changes.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.06: Debug missing change/update block
* T08.G3.04: Trace code with a single if/else




ID: T09.G3.08
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Copy one variable's value to another variable
Description: Students use "set [variable1] to [variable2]" to copy the value from one variable to another. They understand that this creates an independent copy - changing one variable later doesn't affect the other. Examples: "set backup_score to score", "set player_x to enemy_x". This bridges the gap between basic variable operations and using variables in complex expressions.

Dependencies:

ID: T09.G3.09
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Use the reduce block for decreasing variables

This block is designed for young learners who may not yet understand negative numbers. Examples: "reduce lives by 1" when hit by enemy, "reduce time by 1" each second. Students understand that reduce decreases while change-by-positive increases.

ID: T09.G4.06
Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Combine two arithmetic operators in a single expression
Description: Students write expressions that combine exactly two operators in one statement using the same type of operation, such as "a + b + c" or "x * y * z".

Description: Students create variables (using 0/1 or meaningful names like "game_over") to remember whether an event occurred. They set the flag when the event happens (e.g., "set has_key to 1" when collecting a key) and check it in conditionals to control later behavior (e.g., "if has_key = 1 then open door").

## GRADE 3 (15 skills)




ID: T10.G3.01.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Create a new list variable
Description: Students create a new list variable in the Variables palette by clicking "Make a List" and giving it a descriptive name (e.g., "fruits", "scores", "inventory"). Lists are containers that can hold multiple values, unlike regular variables which hold only one value. Students recognize that this is the first step before any list operations can be performed, and verify the empty list appears in the Variables palette.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.01.01: Create a new variable




ID: T10.G3.01.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Add an item to the end of a list
Description: Students use the `add [item] to [list]` block to add items one at a time to the end of a list. They observe how each item is added in sequence (1, 2, 3...) and note that lists grow dynamically as items are added. Students practice adding 3-4 items and use the list monitor to verify the growing list.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.01: Create a new list variable




ID: T10.G3.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
Description: Students use the `item (1) of [list]` block to retrieve specific items from a list by their position number (index). The first item is at position 1, second at position 2, etc. Students practice reading different positions and displaying or using the retrieved values, verifying the correct item is returned.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G3.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Get the length of a list
Description: Students use the `length of [list]` block to find how many items are in a list. They observe that as items are added or removed, the length changes accordingly. This is essential for knowing the bounds when accessing list items and avoiding out-of-range errors.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G3.04.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Delete an item at a specific position
Description: Students use the `delete (position) of [list]` block to remove an item from a specific position in the list. They observe how items after the deleted position shift down (e.g., item 3 becomes item 2) and verify that the list length decreases by 1. Students practice deleting items from different positions (beginning, middle, end) and predict the resulting list state.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G3.04.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Clear all items from a list
Description: Students use the `delete all of [list]` block to remove every item from a list at once, returning it to empty. Clearing is useful for starting fresh or resetting for a new game. Students observe that after clearing, the list length becomes 0 and verify the list monitor shows an empty list.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G3.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Loop through each item in a list
Description: Students use the `for each [item] in [list]` block to automatically visit every item in sequence. Unlike counted repeat loops where you specify a number of repetitions, this block iterates through all items regardless of list length. Students perform simple actions on each item (e.g., say each fruit name) and observe that every item is processed exactly once. Keep the list short (3-4 items) and actions simple.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G3.06
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Check if a list contains a specific item
Description: Students use the `[list] contains [item]?` block to check whether a value exists in a list. They combine this with conditionals to make decisions based on list membership (e.g., "if my fruits list contains 'apple' then say 'I have an apple!'"). Students test with items that are in the list and items that are not.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script




ID: T10.G3.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Count items in a list that match a condition
Description: Students loop through a short list and count items that match a simple condition (e.g., "count numbers greater than 5" or "count items equal to 'apple'"). They use a counter variable that increments inside a conditional inside a loop. Students predict the count before running and verify their prediction matches the result.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G3.08
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Check if a list is empty before accessing
Description: Students check whether a list is empty (has zero items) before trying to read from it, to avoid errors. They use the `length of [list] = 0` condition in an if-statement to guard list access. This defensive programming pattern prevents crashes when dealing with lists that might be empty.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script




ID: T10.G3.09
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Increment or decrement a list item's value
Description: Students use the `change item (position) of [list] by (amount)` block to modify numeric values in a list arithmetically (e.g., increase a player's score by 10, decrease health by 5). This block changes the value in place without needing to manually get-calculate-replace, making score updates and counters much simpler. For young learners who don't know negative numbers, the `reduce item (position) of [list] by (amount)` block provides a simpler way to decrease values. Students verify the change by reading the item before and after modification.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G3.10
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Display a list monitor on the stage
Description: Students enable the list monitor by checking the checkbox next to the list name in the Variables palette. The monitor displays all items with their positions (1, 2, 3...) and updates in real-time as items are added, removed, or changed. Students use visual feedback to verify list state and debug their programs by watching the monitor while running code.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G3.11
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Predict and trace list changes step by step
Description: Students trace through a short sequence of list operations (3-5 blocks) and predict the final state of the list. Given blocks like: create list → add "apple" → add "banana" → delete item 1 → add "cherry", students write down what the list contains after each step and predict the final result ["banana", "cherry"]. This builds mental models of how lists work and prepares students for debugging. Students verify predictions by running the code and comparing actual vs expected results.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
* T10.G3.10: Display a list monitor on the stage




ID: T10.G3.12
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Debug a list program by identifying wrong positions
Description: Students identify and fix bugs in list programs where items are accessed, inserted, or deleted at wrong positions. Given a buggy program that should add items to a shopping cart but produces incorrect results, students use step-by-step execution and list monitors to find where positions are off-by-one or incorrect. They practice common debugging patterns: verifying list contents after each operation, checking that indices are within bounds (1 to length), and understanding how deletions shift subsequent items.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.11: Predict and trace list changes step by step
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G3.13
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use a list to store user inputs
Description: Students create interactive programs that collect multiple inputs from users and store them in a list. They use the `ask and wait` block inside a loop to gather several responses (e.g., "Enter 3 favorite foods"), adding each answer to a list. After collection, they display or process the collected data, such as saying all items back to the user. This introduces the practical pattern of building lists dynamically from user interaction rather than hardcoding values.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop

## GRADE 4 (31 skills)




ID: T10.G4.01.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find an item's position using built-in block
Description: Students use the `item # of [value] in [list]` block to find the position of a value in a list. They understand this returns the index of the first occurrence (or 0 if not found) and practice searching for items in different lists.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G4.01.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement manual linear search with loop
Description: Students implement a simple linear search algorithm by looping through a list, comparing each item to a target value, and reporting the position when found (or "not found" if the loop completes). They use a counter variable for the position and a conditional to check each item. This foundational algorithm skill teaches sequential searching and how the built-in block works internally.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G4.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Store and retrieve parallel list data
Description: Students use two lists in parallel (e.g., "playerNames" and "playerScores") where items at the same index are related. They add items to both lists together and use the same index to retrieve matching data (e.g., "the player at index 2 in names has the score at index 2 in scores"). Students recognize that keeping parallel lists synchronized is critical—adding to one requires adding to the other at the same position.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G4.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
Description: Students use the `insert [item] at (position) of [list]` block to add items at the beginning, middle, or end of a list. They observe how existing items shift to higher indices to make room and verify the new item appears at the correct position. Students practice inserting at position 1 (prepend), at length+1 (append), and at middle positions.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G4.04
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Replace an item in a list
Description: Students use the `replace item (position) of [list] with [value]` block to update an existing item without changing the list length. They practice replacing items based on position and recognize the difference between replacing (overwrites in place, same length) and inserting (shifts existing items, length increases).

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G4.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `sort list [list] from [large to small/small to large]` block to sort numeric or alphabetic lists. They observe how the order changes and note that sorting rearranges items by value. Students verify the sort by reading the first and last items to confirm the order direction.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G4.06.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find the smallest value in a list

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.06.01: Find the smallest value in a list




ID: T10.G4.06.04
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Calculate the average of values in a list
Description: Students use the `[average v] of list [list]` block to find the mean of all numeric values. Average represents a typical/central value and equals sum divided by length. Students apply this to practical scenarios like grade averages, temperature averages, and game score averages.

* T10.G4.06.03: Calculate the sum of all values in a list




ID: T10.G4.06.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find the median value in a list
Description: Students use the `[median v] of list [list]` block to find the middle value when sorted. Median differs from average because it is less affected by outliers. Students identify scenarios where median is more useful than average (income data, test scores with extreme values) by comparing both measures on lists with outliers.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
* T10.G4.06.04: Calculate the average of values in a list




ID: T10.G4.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find the maximum or minimum item in a list manually
Description: Students write a loop to find the largest or smallest item in a numeric list without using built-in blocks. They initialize a "best so far" variable with the first item, loop through remaining items comparing each to the current best, and update the best when a better value is found. Students trace through a 5-item list and track how the "best so far" variable changes. This manual algorithm builds algorithmic thinking for aggregation operations.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G4.08
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Filter items from a list based on a condition
Description: Students loop through a list and build a new filtered list containing only items that satisfy a condition (e.g., "keep only scores > 50"). They create an empty result list, use conditionals inside a loop to check each item, and add matching items to the result list. Students verify the filtered list contains exactly the items that match the condition.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G4.09
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Build a high score list with parallel lists
Description: Students create a leaderboard using two parallel lists (names and scores). When a new score is added, they find the correct position to insert it (to keep scores sorted in descending order) and insert both the name and score at matching positions. Students verify that the leaderboard remains sorted after each insertion.

ID: T10.G4.10
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Swap two items in a list
Description: Students swap the positions of two items in a list using a temporary variable. They store one item in the temp variable, replace it with the other item, then put the temp value in the second position. Students trace through the three-step swap process and verify both items exchange positions correctly. This pattern is a building block for sorting algorithms.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G4.11.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Copy one list to another (replacing contents)
Description: Students use the `copy [list1] to [list2]` block to duplicate a list. This REPLACES all items in list2 with items from list1, so list2's original contents are lost. After copying, both lists have identical items but remain separate (changing one doesn't affect the other). Students verify independence by modifying one list and confirming the other remains unchanged.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list




ID: T10.G4.11.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Append one list to another (adding to end)
Description: Students use the `append [list1] to [list2]` block to add all items from list1 to the END of list2. This PRESERVES list2's original items and adds list1's items below them. Students compare append vs. copy and identify when each is appropriate: copy for backup/duplication, append for combining datasets.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.11.01: Copy one list to another (replacing contents)




ID: T10.G4.12
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Split a text string into a list
Description: Students use the `set [list] to split of [text] with splitter [delimiter]` block to convert text into a list of items (e.g., split "apple,banana,orange" by "," to get a list of three fruits). Students experiment with different delimiters (comma, space, newline) and verify the resulting list contains the expected items. This introduces text processing and list creation from external data.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions




ID: T10.G4.13
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Join list items into a text string
Description: Students use the `join [list] into text with [delimiter]` block to combine list items into a single text string (e.g., join ["red", "green", "blue"] with ", " to get "red, green, blue"). This is the inverse of split and is useful for displaying list contents or saving list data as text.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.12: Split a text string into a list
* T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions




ID: T10.G4.14
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Reverse the order of items in a list

* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G4.15
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Randomly shuffle items in a list
Description: Students use the `reshuffle [list] randomly` block to randomly rearrange all items. Each shuffle produces a different random order. Applications include shuffling cards, randomizing quiz questions, or creating random starting positions. Students note that reshuffling destroys the original order (make a copy first if needed).

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G4.16.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Generate a list of random numbers with options
Description: Students use the `set [list] to (N) random whole numbers between (min) and (max) [no repetition/allow repetition]` block to populate a list with random values. They select whether to allow duplicate numbers and apply this for generating test data, simulating dice rolls, or creating random scores.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G4.16.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Generate seeded random list
Description: Students use the seeded random block `set [list] to (N) random numbers with seed (SEED)` which generates the same sequence when using the same seed. This enables reproducible randomness for games (same level layout with same seed) and testing scenarios requiring consistent random data. Students verify that the same seed always produces the same list.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.16.01: Generate a list of random numbers with options




ID: T10.G4.17
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Delete an item from a list by value
Description: Students use the `delete value [item] from [list]` block to remove the first occurrence of a specific value (e.g., delete "apple" from the fruits list). This finds and removes the item without needing to know its position, which differs from deleting by index. Students test with items that exist (removes first match) and items that don't exist (no change).

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
* T10.G3.06: Check if a list contains a specific item




ID: T10.G4.18
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Loop through list indices
Description: Students use the `for each index [i] in [list]` block to iterate through list positions (1, 2, 3...) instead of values. This is necessary when they need to know both the position and the value, or when they need to modify items while looping. Students compare index-based iteration to value-based iteration and identify use cases for each.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list




ID: T10.G4.19
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find an item containing a substring
Description: Students use the `# of item containing [substring] in [list]` block to find the first list item that includes a partial match (e.g., find first name containing "son" in a names list). Students compare exact matching (T10.G4.01.01) to partial matching and identify when each is appropriate.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.01.01: Find an item's position using built-in block
* T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions




ID: T10.G4.20
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Select multiple items from a list by criteria
Description: Students use the `insert (N) [largest/smallest/random] items from [list1] into [list2]` block to extract top/bottom/random items efficiently. Applications include leaderboards (top 10 scores), random sampling (pick 5 random quiz questions), or filtering extremes (3 coldest days). Students verify results by checking that list2 contains exactly N items matching the specified criteria.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
* T10.G4.06.01: Find the smallest value in a list
* T10.G4.11.02: Append one list to another (adding to end)




ID: T10.G4.21
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Extract a sublist from a range of positions
Description: Students create a new list containing items from a specific range within an existing list. Using a loop from start position to end position, they read each item from the source list and add it to a new result list. For example, to extract items 3-5 from a 10-item list, they loop from 3 to 5, reading and adding each item. This pattern is useful for pagination (show items 11-20), processing chunks of data, or splitting a list into smaller pieces.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)

ID: T10.G4.22
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Transform each item in a list using a loop
Description: Students iterate through a list and apply a transformation to each item (e.g., double all numbers, convert all text to uppercase, add a prefix to each name). They use a loop with index access to read each item, transform it, and replace it in the same position. This pattern introduces the map operation concept where every element is processed uniformly. Students trace through a 4-item list showing the before and after state.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices
* T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list




ID: T10.G4.23
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Reduce a list to a single value using accumulation
Description: Students implement the accumulator pattern to reduce a list to a single result: start with an initial value (0 for sum, 1 for product, empty string for concatenation), loop through all items, and combine each item with the accumulator. Beyond sum (already covered), students apply this pattern to compute products of all numbers, concatenate all strings, or find the longest string. This introduces the reduce/fold concept foundational to functional programming.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T10.G4.06.03: Calculate the sum of all values in a list




ID: T10.G4.24
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Predict list state after a sequence of operations
Description: Students read a sequence of 5-7 list operations (add, delete, insert, replace) and predict the final list contents without running the code. They trace through each operation step by step, writing the list state after each step, then verify their prediction by running the code. This skill emphasizes understanding how each operation modifies the list and develops mental execution abilities critical for debugging and algorithm design.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.11: Predict and trace list changes step by step
* T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
* T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list

## GRADE 5 (26 skills)




ID: T10.G5.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Identify table structure (rows, columns, cells)
Description: Students identify and label the parts of a table: rows (horizontal, numbered), columns (vertical, named), and cells (values at row-column intersections). Given a sample table, they state the number of rows and columns, identify the value at a specific row-column intersection, and explain that each row represents one record while each column represents one attribute. Students recognize that a table is like having multiple parallel lists (one list per column) organized together, where all lists have the same length and items at the same position are related. A table makes it easier to manage related data than using many separate parallel lists.

ID: T10.G5.11.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Delete a single column
Description: Students use the `delete column [name] from table [table]` block to permanently remove a column and ALL its data. They understand this cannot be undone, remaining columns shift left, and the table structure changes. They identify when column deletion is appropriate vs. just clearing cell values.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.11.01: Add a column at a specific position
* T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table




ID: T10.G5.11.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Remove all columns from a table
Description: Students use the `delete all columns from table [table]` block to completely reset a table to empty structure (no columns, no rows). They understand this is more destructive than deleting all rows (which keeps columns) and use this when completely restructuring a table.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.11.02: Delete a single column




ID: T10.G5.12
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Copy list data to table column
Description: Students use the `copy list [list] to column [name] of table [table]` block to populate or replace an entire column with list values. They understand this requires the column to already exist and will overwrite existing data in that column.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.02: Create a table and add columns
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G5.10: Convert between lists and tables

* T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list




ID: T10.G5.14
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Replace an entire row in a table
Description: Students use `replace row (n) of table [table] with: [cell1] [cell2] ...` to overwrite all values in a row at once. They compare this to updating individual cells (T10.G5.05) and understand when replacing entire rows is more efficient.

Dependencies:

* T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table




ID: T10.G5.15
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Get an entire row as a text string
Description: Students use `row (n) of table [table] separator [sep]` to extract all values from a row as a single text string with specified separator. They use this to display row data, save row snapshots, or pass row data to other parts of the program. They understand this returns text (e.g., "apple,banana,orange"), not a list data structure.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
* T10.G5.10: Convert between lists and tables
* T10.G4.12: Split a text string into a list

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.06.02: Find which row contains a value
* T10.G4.19: Find an item containing a substring




ID: T10.G5.17
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Increment or decrement a table cell value
Description: Students use `change item at row (n) column [name] of table [table] by (amount)` to modify numeric cell values arithmetically (e.g., increase a player's score by 10, decrease inventory by 3). For young learners, the `reduce item at row (n) column [name] of table [table] by (amount)` block provides a simpler way to decrease values without negative numbers. Students compare this to replacement (T10.G5.05) and recognize when arithmetic modification is more efficient than get-calculate-replace patterns.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.05: Update a cell value in a table
* T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
* T10.G3.09: Increment or decrement a list item's value

ID: T10.G5.19
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Build a filtered table manually using conditionals
Description: Students create a new table containing only rows that match a specific condition by looping through the source table and using if-statements. For each row, they check if a column value meets a criterion (e.g., score > 80), and if so, add that row to a result table. This manual filtering approach builds the algorithmic thinking needed before using advanced built-in filter operations in Grade 6. Students trace through 5-7 sample rows and verify their filtered result contains exactly the matching rows.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.06.01: Get the number of rows in a table

Description: Students identify and fix bugs in table programs where cells are accessed at wrong row-column combinations, rows are skipped in loops, or data is written to incorrect positions. Given a buggy program that should update a student gradebook but produces incorrect results, students use step-by-step execution and table monitors to trace which cells are being read or written. They practice common debugging patterns: logging row/column indices during loops, verifying cell values match expectations, and checking loop bounds against row count.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
* T10.G5.07: Loop through table rows to compute aggregates
* T10.G3.12: Debug a list program by identifying wrong positions




ID: T10.G5.21
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables

Description: Students write programs that compare values in different columns of the same row to make decisions or compute derived values. Examples: compare "budget" and "spent" columns to find rows that are over budget, compare "expected" and "actual" columns to calculate differences, or compare "score1" and "score2" columns to determine which is higher. Students loop through rows, read both column values, apply comparison logic, and either flag rows, update a third column, or count matches.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
* T10.G5.07: Loop through table rows to compute aggregates
* T08.G4.01: Combine two conditions with AND

Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Sort a table by a column
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `sort table [table] by column [name] [large to small/small to large]` block to reorder rows based on values in a column. They understand sorting preserves row integrity (all columns in a row stay together). Students verify the sort worked by reading cell values before and after.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
* T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.19: Build a filtered table manually using conditionals
* T08.G5.01: Use compound conditions with and/or/not




ID: T10.G6.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Copy and append tables
Description: Students use `copy table [t1] into [t2]` to duplicate a table and `append table [t1] to [t2]` to combine tables vertically. Vertical appending adds new rows below existing rows; both tables must have matching columns for append to work correctly.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table




ID: T10.G6.04
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use table lookup to find related data
Description: Students use the `item in column [return_col] of [table] where column [search_col] equals [value]` block to look up data. For example, find a student's grade by looking up their name, similar to VLOOKUP in spreadsheets.

Dependencies:

* T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table




ID: T10.G6.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Group data and compute aggregates per group
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `set table [result] to [method] of column [value_col] in table [source] by column [group_col]` block to group rows by a category and compute statistics (sum, average, count) for each group, creating a summary table.

Dependencies:

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.08: Filter items from a list based on a condition
* T10.G3.06: Check if a list contains a specific item




ID: T10.G6.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables

* T10.G4.08: Filter items from a list based on a condition




ID: T10.G6.08
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Shuffle table rows randomly
Description: Students use the `reshuffle table [table] randomly` block to randomize row order while keeping row integrity (all columns in a row stay together). Applications include randomizing quiz questions stored in tables, shuffling game data, or anonymizing datasets for privacy.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.15: Randomly shuffle items in a list
* T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table




ID: T10.G6.09
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Create and populate a nested list (2D array)
Description: Students create a list where each item is itself a list, forming a 2D grid structure. For example, a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board can be represented as a list of 3 rows, where each row is a list of 3 cells. Students create the structure by making an outer list, then adding inner lists as items. They populate cells by first accessing the inner list, then setting items within it. This introduces the concept of nested data structures as an alternative to tables for grid-based data.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
* T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
* T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list




ID: T10.G6.10
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Access elements in a nested list using row and column indices
Description: Students read and write values in a 2D list using two indices: first to select the row (outer list item), then to select the column (inner list item). For example, to get the value at row 2, column 3 of a grid, they use `item 3 of (item 2 of grid)`. Students practice navigating the nested structure and recognize that accessing requires two steps: outer index first, then inner index.

Dependencies:
* T10.G6.09: Create and populate a nested list (2D array)
* T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices




ID: T10.G6.11
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Iterate through all elements of a 2D array with nested loops
Description: Students use nested loops to visit every cell in a 2D array: the outer loop iterates through rows (1 to number of rows), and the inner loop iterates through columns (1 to number of columns in that row). For each cell, they perform an operation like summing values, finding the maximum, or checking for a condition. Students trace through a 3x3 grid and predict the order in which cells are visited (row-major order).

Dependencies:
* T10.G6.10: Access elements in a nested list using row and column indices
* T07.G6.01: Trace nested loops with variable bounds




ID: T10.G6.12
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement queue operations (enqueue and dequeue)
Description: Students implement queue behavior using a list: enqueue (add to end), dequeue (remove and return first item), and peek (read first item without removing). They use `add [item] to [queue]` for enqueue, `item (1) of [queue]` with `delete (1) of [queue]` for dequeue, and recognize FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior. Applications include task queues (process tasks in order received), print queues, breadth-first traversal, and simulating waiting lines. Students contrast FIFO (queue) with LIFO (stack) behavior by tracing the same operations on both data structures.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
* T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G6.13
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use frequency counting with lists
Description: Students count occurrences of each unique value in a list by using parallel lists (one for unique values, one for counts). They loop through the source list, check if each item exists in the values list, and either increment its count or add a new entry. This technique enables finding the most/least frequent items, creating histograms, and analyzing data distributions. Students apply this to real scenarios like counting votes, tallying survey responses, or finding the mode of a dataset.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
* T10.G4.01.01: Find an item's position using built-in block
* T10.G3.09: Increment or decrement a list item's value




ID: T10.G6.14
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
Description: Students implement the merge algorithm: given two already-sorted lists, combine them into one sorted list without re-sorting. They use two pointers (one for each list), repeatedly compare the current items, add the smaller one to the result, and advance that pointer. This O(n) algorithm is more efficient than concatenating and re-sorting O(n log n), and is a building block for merge sort. Students trace through merging [1, 4, 7] and [2, 3, 8] step by step.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
* T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices

ID: T10.G6.15
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Swap adjacent items based on comparison
Description: Students practice the swap pattern in the context of sorting: compare two adjacent items, swap them if out of order, and recognize that multiple passes are needed to fully sort. They trace through swapping adjacent pairs and observe how items gradually move toward correct positions. This builds directly toward implementing bubble sort and selection sort algorithms in Grade 8.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.10: Swap two items in a list
* T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices




ID: T10.G6.16
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find maximum in a sublist range
Description: Students extend the manual find-max algorithm (T10.G4.07) to find the maximum or minimum within a specific range of indices, not the entire list. They loop from a start position to an end position, tracking the best value and its position. This pattern is essential for selection sort (find min in remaining unsorted portion) and other range-based algorithms.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.07: Find the maximum or minimum item in a list manually
* T10.G4.21: Extract a sublist from a range of positions




ID: T10.G6.17
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Parse text into structured list data
Description: Students use text splitting and string operations to parse semi-structured text (like CSV lines, simple log entries, or formatted strings) into list items for programmatic processing. They use the split block to break text by delimiters, handle edge cases like extra spaces, and build lists from parsed text. This bridges text manipulation and list operations, preparing for complex data parsing in Grade 8.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.12: Split a text string into a list
* T10.G4.08: Filter items from a list based on a condition




ID: T10.G6.18
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Select a random item from a list
Description: Students use the `item (random v) of [list]` block or generate a random index using `pick random (1) to (length of [list])` to select items at random. Applications include picking random quiz questions, selecting random game events, or implementing simple random sampling. Students verify that multiple runs produce different selections and understand the difference between random access and sequential access.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices
* T10.G4.15: Randomly shuffle items in a list

ID: T10.G7.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario
Description: Students design the structure of a table (what columns to include, what data types they hold) to model a real-world domain. They create a table with appropriate column names, justify their design choices (why these columns? what data type?), and demonstrate by populating the table with sample data that validates their design. Example domains: Library catalog (columns: title, author, ISBN, genre, available_copies); Game inventory (item_name, item_type, quantity, value, rarity); Sports statistics (player_name, team, position, points, assists).

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.02: Create a table and add columns




ID: T10.G7.04
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Visualize table data with charts

ID: T10.G7.15
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement stack operations (push and pop)
Description: Students implement stack behavior using a list: push (add to end), pop (remove and return last item), and peek (read last item without removing). They use `add [item] to [stack]` for push, `item (length of [stack]) of [stack]` with `delete (length of [stack]) of [stack]` for pop, and recognize LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior. Applications include undo functionality (push each action, pop to undo), expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use KNN classification with table data
Description: Students use CreatiCode's KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) blocks to classify new data points based on existing labeled data stored in a table. They prepare training data in a table with feature columns and a label column, use the `add training data from table [table] features [cols] labels [col]` block, then classify new inputs using the trained model. Students experiment with different k values and observe how it affects classification accuracy. This introduces supervised machine learning concepts using familiar table data.

ID: T10.G7.17
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Build a simple recommendation system using tables
Description: Students create a basic recommendation system using table data and similarity calculations. Given a table of users and their ratings/preferences (e.g., movie ratings, product reviews), students find similar users by comparing their ratings, then recommend items that similar users liked but the target user hasn't seen. They implement a simple similarity measure (count of matching ratings) and use table lookups to generate recommendations. This practical application combines table operations with real-world data analysis.

Dependencies:
* T10.G6.04: Use table lookup to find related data

ID: T10.G7.18
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Debug table operations by logging intermediate states
Description: Students develop systematic debugging strategies for table programs: logging row/column values during loops using console output, checking boundary conditions (first row, last row, empty table), verifying column values match expected types, and using table snapshots to compare before/after states. Given a buggy table program, students add logging statements to trace execution, identify where values diverge from expectations, and fix the issue. This skill builds on list debugging (T10.G3.12) but addresses table-specific challenges like multi-column access patterns and row counting errors.

* T10.G5.20: Debug table programs by tracing row and column access
* T10.G7.06: Validate and handle missing data in tables




ID: T10.G7.19
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Insert and update database records from table data
Description: Students use CreatiCode's database blocks to persist table data beyond individual sessions. They use `insert from table [table] row from (start) to (end) into collection [collection]` to add records to a database collection, and `update collection [collection] from table [table]` to modify existing records. Students understand the difference between local tables (temporary, in memory) and database collections (persistent, shared), and design programs that sync data between tables and databases appropriately.

They construct filter conditions, apply sorting, limit result counts for performance, and process the fetched data using table operations. This skill bridges the gap between simple table operations and real database querying, preparing students for SQL concepts.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.19: Insert and update database records from table data
* T10.G6.02: Filter table rows based on a condition

## GRADE 8 (18 skills)




ID: T10.G8.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use nested loops to compare data across two tables

* T10.G6.04: Use table lookup to find related data




ID: T10.G8.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables

* T07.G6.01: Trace nested loops with variable bounds




ID: T10.G8.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables

* T10.G6.01: Sort a table by a column




ID: T10.G8.06
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables

* T10.G7.03: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario




ID: T10.G8.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement a hash table lookup using lists
Description: Students simulate a simple hash table by using a list where each position corresponds to a hash value computed using modulo operation (e.g., hash(key) = key mod list_length for numbers, or sum of character codes mod list_length for strings). They handle collisions using linear probing (check next positions) or chaining (store multiple items at one position using lists within lists). Implementation pattern: Use a list as the hash table, create a hash function using math operators and string blocks, use linear search as fallback for collisions, and compare performance to linear search to demonstrate the principle of constant-time lookup.

Dependencies:

* T10.G6.13: Use frequency counting with lists
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches




ID: T10.G8.08.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement binary search on sorted lists
Description: Students implement binary search algorithm to find items in O(log n) time instead of O(n) linear search. They repeatedly divide the sorted list's search space in half: compare the middle element to the target, then search either the left half (if target is smaller) or right half (if target is larger). Students trace through the algorithm step-by-step, counting comparisons, and compare performance to linear search to demonstrate logarithmic efficiency gains. This introduces divide-and-conquer algorithmic thinking.

Dependencies:

* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches




ID: T10.G8.08.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use two-pointer technique for list problems
Description: Students apply two-pointer techniques where pointers move from both ends toward the center to solve problems efficiently. Common patterns: Finding pairs that sum to a target value (one pointer at start, one at end, move based on comparison), removing duplicates from sorted lists (slow and fast pointers), or checking palindromes (compare from both ends). Students implement at least one two-pointer algorithm, trace pointer movements, and understand how this technique avoids nested loops for certain problems.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.08.01: Implement binary search on sorted lists
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches




ID: T10.G8.08.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Apply sliding window algorithms
Description: Students use sliding window algorithms to efficiently process contiguous subarrays by maintaining a window that slides through the data. Common applications: finding maximum sum of k consecutive elements, longest substring without repeating characters, or moving averages. Implementation pattern: Initialize window with first k elements, slide window right by adding next element and removing leftmost element, track window state (sum, max, set of unique items), update result after each slide. Students understand how sliding window reduces O(n*k) to O(n) by reusing previous computations.

* T10.G8.08.02: Use two-pointer technique for list problems
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches




ID: T10.G8.09
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement a priority queue using sorted insertion
Description: Students implement a priority queue where items are always retrieved in priority order (highest or lowest first). They maintain a sorted list by inserting new items at the correct position (binary search for position, then insert) rather than sorting after each insertion. Students compare this O(n) insertion with O(1) removal to naive approaches (O(1) insertion with O(n) search for removal). Applications include task schedulers, event-driven simulations, and Dijkstra's algorithm foundations.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.08.01: Implement binary search on sorted lists
* T10.G6.12: Implement queue operations (enqueue and dequeue)




ID: T10.G8.10
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Parse and process structured text into tables
Description: Students write programs to parse structured text data (log files, configuration files, semi-structured reports) into tables for analysis. They use string operations (split, find, substring) to extract fields from each line, handle variations in format, skip header/footer lines, and build a clean table from messy input. This real-world skill prepares students for data engineering tasks where raw data must be cleaned and structured before analysis.

Dependencies:

* T10.G6.17: Parse text into structured list data
* T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table




ID: T10.G8.11
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Design and implement a data pipeline with multiple transformations
Description: Students design a multi-step data processing pipeline: import raw data → clean/validate → transform → aggregate → visualize/export. They chain together table operations learned throughout T10 to build an end-to-end solution for a realistic scenario (e.g., process survey data, analyze game statistics, generate a report from transaction logs). Students document their pipeline design before implementing, handle errors gracefully, and verify output quality at each stage.

ID: T10.G8.12
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Build a semantic search database from table data
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `create semantic database from table [table]` block to build a searchable database where queries find results by meaning rather than exact keyword matching. They prepare a table with a required 'key' column and additional data columns, understand that the semantic database uses AI embeddings to find similar content, and test queries to verify relevant results are returned. Applications include building a FAQ search system, finding similar products, or creating a knowledge base that users can query in natural language.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.06: Model relationships using multiple linked tables
* T10.G7.14: Use AI to analyze table data




ID: T10.G8.13
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Query semantic databases with natural language and filters
Description: Students use `search semantic database with [query] store top (K) in table [result]` and `search semantic database with [query] where [condition] store top (K) in table [result]` to find relevant data using natural language queries. They experiment with different queries to understand how semantic similarity works, apply filters to narrow results, and compare semantic search to exact-match lookups. Students build a practical application (e.g., a smart assistant that answers questions from a knowledge base).

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.12: Build a semantic search database from table data
* T10.G6.02: Filter table rows based on a condition




ID: T10.G8.14
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use moving averages to analyze time-series data in lists
Description: Students use `value from [simple/exponential] moving average window [length] of list [list]` to smooth noisy data and identify trends. They understand that moving averages calculate the average over a sliding window, compare simple vs. exponential methods (exponential gives more weight to recent values), and apply this to real scenarios: smoothing sensor readings, analyzing stock prices, or detecting trends in game metrics. Students visualize raw vs. smoothed data to see the difference.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.03: Implement selection sort algorithm step by step
* T10.G7.07: Analyze a dataset to find patterns or outliers




ID: T10.G8.15
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Store and retrieve AI vision data from tables
Description: Students capture real-time AI data (hand detection, body pose, face detection) into tables using blocks like `run hand detection table [table]` and `run 2D body part recognition ... table [table]`. They understand the table structure output by these AI blocks (rows for each detected point, columns for x/y coordinates and confidence), write code to process this data (e.g., detect specific gestures, track movement over time), and combine AI sensing with table operations to build interactive applications.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.04: Build a simulation using table-based state
* T10.G7.03: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario

ID: T11.GK.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Circle picture cards that belong together
Description: Students identify activities that naturally belong together as a group by circling related picture cards with colored markers. For example, in a picture sequence showing "get ready for school," they circle all the steps about eating breakfast (get bowl, pour cereal, add milk, eat) in blue and all the steps about getting dressed in green. This builds the foundational idea that actions can be organized into meaningful clusters.

Assessment example: Given 12 picture cards showing a morning routine, students use colored circles to group related activities: breakfast steps in blue, getting dressed steps in green, brushing teeth steps in yellow. They explain why each group belongs together.

Dependencies:
* T01.GK.03: Find the first and last pictures
* T03.GK.01: Tap picture cards to identify parts of a whole object

---

ID: T11.GK.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Select a clear name for a picture card group
Description: Students select a clear, descriptive name for a group of related picture cards from multiple choice options. After grouping activities together (like in T11.GK.01), they choose a name that describes what the whole group does. For example, a group of steps about mixing ingredients should be called "Make the Batter" rather than vague names like "Step 1" or "The First Part."

Assessment example: Given three groups of picture cards (1: wash hands, put on apron, get ingredients; 2: mix, stir, pour; 3: put in oven, set timer, wait), students select appropriate names from options: "Get Ready," "Make the Batter," and "Bake the Cake" (rejecting vague options like "First Things" or "More Stuff").

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.01: Circle picture cards that belong together

---

ID: T11.GK.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Drag a named group card into a bigger picture plan
Description: Students drag named group cards into slots in a larger picture plan to simplify instructions. For example, instead of listing all breakfast steps again, a morning routine uses a single "Do Breakfast" card. Students drag named cards like "Do Breakfast," "Get Dressed," and "Pack Backpack" into the correct slots. This introduces abstraction: once you name a group, you refer to it by that single name.

Assessment example: Given three named group cards ("Do Breakfast," "Get Dressed," "Pack Backpack") and a "Get Ready for School" plan with three empty slots, students drag each card into the correct slot to create a simplified 3-step plan.

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.02: Select a clear name for a picture card group

---

ID: T11.GK.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Predict what happens when a group card is used
Description: Students view a named group card (like "Clean Up") and its picture steps. Then see a bigger plan that uses this group card. They predict which picture steps will happen when the plan reaches "Clean Up." For example, the group card "Make Snack" shows: get apple, wash apple, cut apple. Main plan shows: Do Homework → Make Snack → Watch TV. Students tap to select which pictures happen during "Make Snack." This builds understanding that using a group card means executing all steps inside it.

Assessment example: Given "Make Snack" group card with 3 steps and a daily routine that uses it, students tap all pictures that happen when "Make Snack" runs.

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.03: Drag a named group card into a bigger picture plan

---

ID: T11.GK.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Predict what happens when a group card is skipped
Description: Students view a complete plan with several group cards (e.g., "Wake Up" → "Eat Breakfast" → "Get Dressed" → "Go to School"). They see one group card crossed out or removed. They predict what will be different in the final outcome if that group card is skipped. For example, if "Eat Breakfast" is skipped, the child goes to school hungry. This builds understanding of how each group contributes to the whole plan.

Assessment example: Given a morning routine plan with "Eat Breakfast" crossed out, students select from options: "The child will be hungry at school" (correct), "The child will be late" (incorrect), "Nothing will be different" (incorrect).

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.04: Predict what happens when a group card is used

ID: T11.G1.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify the main instruction set from picture cards
Description: Students examine 2–3 short sets of picture‑based instructions (e.g., "how to set up the game," "how to decorate," "how to clean up") and tap on the set that tells everyone what to do overall for an activity. This builds the idea that some instructions are the main plan and others are helper tasks.

Assessment example: Given three picture card sets for a birthday party, students tap on the "Run the Party" set (not "Set Up Decorations" or "Clean Up") as the main instructions that reference the other sets.

Dependencies:
* T01.GK.03: Find the first and last pictures

---

ID: T11.G1.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Match picture step groups to clear titles
Description: Students match each group of picture steps to a clear title that tells what it is for (e.g., "Getting Ready," "Playing the Game," "Clean‑Up Time"). They draw lines from picture groups to title labels, rejecting vague titles like "Stuff" or "Things to Do."

Assessment example: Given three picture groups and six title options (three good, three vague), students draw lines connecting each group to its clear title, explaining why "Set Up the Game" is better than "Some Stuff."

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.01: Identify the main instruction set from picture cards

---

ID: T11.G1.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Match picture groups to their purpose descriptions
Description: Students see 2–3 groups of picture instructions for a class routine and match each group to a simple purpose description by drawing lines. For example: "These steps get the classroom ready," "These steps are for playing," "These steps are for cleaning up." This strengthens the habit of explaining the role of each part of a plan.

Assessment example: Given three picture groups for a class art project and three description cards, students draw lines matching each group to its purpose: "Get supplies" → "These steps gather what we need."

Dependencies:
* T03.GK.01: Tap picture cards to identify parts of a whole object

---

ID: T11.G1.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Drag picture cards to split into two category boxes
Description: Students drag picture cards from a long mixed list into two labeled category boxes (e.g., "Before the event" and "During the event," or "Adult jobs" and "Student jobs"). This mirrors splitting one big routine into smaller, organized parts.

Assessment example: Given 8 picture cards for a school field trip and two boxes labeled "Before We Leave" and "At the Museum," students drag each card into the correct box.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.01: Identify the main instruction set from picture cards

ID: T11.G1.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify repeated activity groups in a picture sequence
Description: Students examine a longer picture-based activity plan and circle each occurrence of the same group of actions that appears multiple times. For example, in a "classroom game" sequence, they circle all instances of "reset the game board" (put pieces back, shuffle cards, reset timer) that happen before each round. This builds recognition of repetition at the group level, not just single actions.

Assessment example: Given a picture sequence for playing three rounds of a board game, students use colored circles to mark each occurrence of the "setup" activities that appear before each round, counting how many times the same group repeats.

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.03: Drag a named group card into a bigger picture plan
* T04.G1.01: Notice when steps repeat in a sequence

---

ID: T11.G1.06
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Create a label card for repeated activity groups
Description: Students create a label card for a group of activities that repeats, writing a clear name so they can refer to it instead of repeating the same steps multiple times. This introduces the practical benefit of naming: it saves time and reduces clutter.

Assessment example: After identifying that "clean workspace" (wipe table, throw away trash, put supplies away) happens multiple times in an art project, students write "Clean Workspace" on a label card and explain where to place it in the sequence.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.05: Identify repeated activity groups in a picture sequence
* T11.GK.02: Select a clear name for a picture card group

---

ID: T11.G1.07
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Replace repeated picture groups with label cards
Description: Students simplify a complex picture-based plan by replacing repeated activity groups with their label cards. Where they previously had the full sequence of steps repeated, they now drag in a single label card. This demonstrates how abstraction reduces complexity and makes plans easier to read.

Assessment example: Students take a 20-step picture sequence for a class activity that has three repeated "clean up" sections and replace each occurrence with a single "Clean Up" label card, reducing the visible sequence to 14 steps plus a labeled definition box for "Clean Up."

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Decide between one label or multiple similar labels
Description: Students identify when activity groups are similar but not identical, deciding whether to create one shared label or multiple specific labels. For example, "Set Up for Game 1" and "Set Up for Game 2" involve similar activities but with different materials. This introduces the idea that sometimes you need multiple related groups rather than one group with variations.

Assessment example: Given a sequence for running two different classroom games, students compare the "setup" phases and decide whether to create "Setup Game 1" and "Setup Game 2" labels or find enough commonality for a single "Setup Game" label, explaining their reasoning.

Skill: Arrange group cards to form a complete plan
Description: Students are given 4-6 labeled group cards (e.g., "Wake Up," "Eat Breakfast," "Get Dressed," "Go to School," "Come Home," "Do Homework") and arrange them in the correct order to form a complete daily plan. This skill emphasizes ordering groups at a higher level of abstraction, treating each group as a single unit. Students must think about the logical flow of grouped activities.

Assessment example: Given 5 group cards for a school day, students drag them into the correct sequence and explain why "Get Dressed" must come before "Go to School" but "Eat Breakfast" could happen before or after "Get Dressed."

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Write a note card explaining a section's purpose
Description: Students write a short note card and attach it near a group of picture steps to explain why that section is there (e.g., "These steps are to get ready," "These steps are to clean up"). This is an unplugged analogue of code comments.

Assessment example: Given a picture plan with three sections, students write three note cards explaining each section's purpose and place them next to the appropriate groups.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Replace vague labels with clear descriptive titles
Description: Students identify vague or unclear section titles in a plan (e.g., "Stuff," "More things") and replace them with clearer titles that match the steps underneath (e.g., "Set up chairs," "Decorate the room"). They cross out bad labels and write better ones.

Assessment example: Given a plan with labels "Thing 1," "Other Stuff," and "Last Part," students examine each section's picture cards and rewrite the labels as "Gather Supplies," "Build the Project," and "Clean Up."

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.02: Match picture step groups to clear titles

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Edit section titles to follow a consistent style
Description: Students review several section titles for one plan (e.g., "Set up," "Playing the game," "Clean up time!") and edit them to follow a similar style (for example, all starting with action words like "Set Up," "Play Game," "Clean Up"). This builds awareness of consistent naming.

Assessment example: Given titles "Getting ready," "PLAY!!!", and "clean-up time," students rewrite all three in a consistent style: "Get Ready," "Play the Game," "Clean Up."

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Sort picture cards under category headings
Description: Students see 2–3 headings (e.g., "Before class," "During class," "After class") and a mixed set of picture step cards, then drag each card under the heading where it belongs. This extends the Grade 1 idea of splitting lists into clearly labeled sections.

Assessment example: Given headings "Morning," "Lunch," "Afternoon" and 9 mixed picture cards, students drag each card under the correct heading, creating three organized groups.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Label activity groups for clarity, not just repetition
Description: Students decide whether to create labeled groups based on organization benefits, not just repetition. Some groups should be named and separated even if they only happen once, because they represent distinct phases. For example, "Check Safety Rules" might happen only once but deserves its own label for clarity.

Assessment example: Given a field trip plan, students mark which activity groups should get labels: some because they repeat (like "count students"), others because they're important distinct phases (like "review safety rules" or "board the bus") even though they happen only once.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Organize a plan into 3-5 labeled groups
Description: Students organize a moderately complex activity plan into 3-5 labeled groups that work together to accomplish the overall goal. They identify natural boundaries between groups and give each a clear name. This builds decomposition skills: breaking a large plan into coordinated, named pieces.

Assessment example: For a "make and serve snacks" activity, students create labels for: "Wash Hands," "Prepare Snacks," "Set Table," "Serve Snacks," "Clean Up," drawing boundaries between groups and explaining how each contributes to the whole activity.

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.05: Label activity groups for clarity, not just repetition

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Draw arrows showing which groups must happen first
Description: Students draw arrows between labeled groups to show when one must happen before another, and identify groups that can happen in any order. They use simple language like "you must do Wash Hands before Prepare Snacks" or "Set Table can happen before or after Prepare Snacks."

Assessment example: Given 5 labeled activity groups for a class party, students draw arrows showing dependencies (e.g., "Set Up" → "Play Games" → "Clean Up") and circle groups that can happen in any order, explaining their reasoning.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Sort labels into reusable vs. plan-specific categories
Description: Students identify labeled activity groups that could be useful in multiple different plans, not just the current one. For example, "Wash Hands" and "Clean Workspace" are useful in many activities (art, science, cooking). They sort labels into "reusable" and "plan-specific" categories.

Assessment example: After creating labeled groups for a cooking activity, students sort labels into two boxes: "Only for cooking" (like "Mix Ingredients") and "Useful for other activities" (like "Wash Hands" or "Clean Up"), then name two other activities where reusable labels could be used.

Dependencies:

ID: T11.G2.09
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Write one-sentence purpose descriptions for each group
Description: Students write one sentence describing what each labeled activity group is meant to accomplish and why it's part of the overall plan. This focuses on the WHAT and WHY (the group's purpose) rather than HOW (the specific steps inside). This prepares students to design and document custom blocks with clear purposes.

Assessment example: For a classroom activity broken into labeled groups, students complete sentences like "The Setup Group gets everything ready so we can start the activity" and "The Practice Group helps us learn the new skill before we try it ourselves."

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Match a simplified plan to its detailed version
Description: Students are shown two versions of the same plan: a simplified version using group cards (e.g., "Get Ready" → "Do Activity" → "Clean Up") and a detailed version showing all individual picture steps. They match the group cards in the simplified plan to the corresponding sections in the detailed plan. This builds abstraction recognition: understanding that a high-level name represents a collection of detailed steps.

Assessment example: Given a 3-step simplified plan ("Setup" → "Play" → "Cleanup") and a 15-step detailed plan, students draw lines connecting each group card to its corresponding section of detailed steps.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Connect picture-based grouping to code-based custom blocks
Description: Students view side-by-side comparisons of picture-based grouped activities and code-based custom blocks, identifying the conceptual parallel. They see how a picture card labeled "Clean Up" that contains multiple steps is like a custom block called "CleanUp" that contains multiple code blocks. This bridge skill explicitly connects concrete picture-based abstraction (from K-2) to code-based abstraction (G3+), helping students transfer their understanding of grouping and naming to programming.

Assessment example: Students view pairs of examples (picture plan with "Make Snack" group card + code with "define MakeSnack" custom block) and explain in their own words how the two are similar: both use a single name to represent multiple steps.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Insert a comment block to explain code purpose
Description: Students insert the comment block (// [text]) from the My Blocks category to add simple comments that label or explain parts of their script (e.g., "// Move the cat" or "// Check if score > 10"). This introduces documenting code for others to understand.

Assessment example: Given a 5-block script, students add a comment block above each section explaining its purpose, then another student reads only the comments to describe what the script does.

ID: T11.G3.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Write a header comment summarizing script purpose
Description: Students add a comment block (// [text]) at the beginning of a script, right after the hat block, that summarizes the script's purpose and role in the larger program (e.g., "// Game initialization: sets lives to 3, resets score, shows start screen"). This is a first step toward systematic documentation.

Assessment example: Given three scripts without header comments, students write appropriate header comments that summarize what each script does in one sentence.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
* T11.G3.01: Insert a comment block to explain code purpose

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Rename vague variables to descriptive names
Description: Students examine a script with unclear variable names (e.g., "x", "temp", "v1") and rename them to be more descriptive and meaningful (e.g., "playerScore", "enemySpeed", "livesRemaining"). They identify vague names and replace them with names that clearly indicate what the variable represents.

Assessment example: Given a script with variables named "a", "x", and "n", students rename them to "score", "playerX", and "livesLeft" based on how they're used in the code.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.01: Create a variable and set its starting value

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Merge consecutive similar blocks into one efficient block
Description: Students identify patterns of similar consecutive blocks (e.g., multiple "move 10 steps" blocks or repeated "change score by 1" blocks) and combine them into single, more efficient blocks with appropriate values (e.g., "move 30 steps" or "change score by 3"). This reduces redundancy and makes code cleaner.

Assessment example: Given a script with "move 10 steps" repeated 5 times, students delete 4 blocks and change the remaining one to "move 50 steps", verifying the behavior is the same.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.03: Build a forever loop for simple animation

ID: T11.G3.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Describe how multiple scripts work together in a project
Description: Students write or select explanations for how the scripts in a project interact and fit together (e.g., "The green-flag script sets up the game, and the key-press scripts let the player control the character"). This develops understanding of overall code organization.

Assessment example: Given a project with 4 scripts, students write one sentence describing each script's role and draw arrows showing how they relate (e.g., "Setup script initializes variables that Game script uses").

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence

ID: T11.G3.06
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Define a custom block without parameters
Description: Students create simple custom blocks without parameters using CreatiCode's define syntax. In the My Blocks category, they create a custom block with a descriptive, action-based name (e.g., define (draw square)) that groups 3-5 related blocks. The focus is on understanding how to define a reusable block using the define (BLOCKSIGNATURE) syntax.

Assessment example: Students create a custom block named "DrawSquare" that contains 4 blocks (repeat 4: move 50 steps, turn 90 degrees) and verify it works when called.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Call a custom block using the call syntax
Description: Students call a custom block they created using the call syntax (e.g., call draw square). They replace repeated code in their main script with calls to the custom block, experiencing how custom blocks make code more organized and easier to read.

Assessment example: Students take a script with repeated code and replace 3 identical sections with "call DrawSquare", verifying the program still works correctly.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Distinguish custom blocks from built-in blocks
Description: Students learn that CreatiCode has two types of blocks: built-in blocks (provided by CreatiCode, like "move 10 steps" or "say Hello") and custom blocks (created by programmers, found in the "My Blocks" category). They examine several example projects and identify which blocks are custom (defined by the programmer) versus built-in (provided by the system). They understand that custom blocks are tools programmers create to organize their own code.

Assessment example: Given a script with 8-10 blocks including some from "Motion," "Looks," and "My Blocks" categories, students identify which blocks are custom (from My Blocks) and which are built-in, explaining how they can tell.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T02.G3.01: Match a short block script to the right task

ID: T11.G3.10
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Distinguish when to use custom blocks vs loops
Description: Students identify scenarios where a custom block (called "My Block" in CreatiCode) is more appropriate than a loop. They recognize that loops repeat the SAME action multiple times, while custom blocks group a SEQUENCE of different actions for reuse or organization. Given example scripts or problems, they choose the better organizational approach and explain their reasoning. This conceptual gateway skill builds organizational thinking without requiring students to define custom blocks yet.

Assessment example: Present 3-4 scenarios (e.g., "draw a house," "move 10 steps 5 times," "reset game state," "count to 10"). Students label each as better solved with a loop or a custom block and explain why.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple loop
* T01.G3.12: Predict the final state of a simple algorithm

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Trace what happens inside a custom block definition
Description: Students trace step-by-step through a simple custom block definition (3-5 blocks) to predict what the sprite will do when the block is called. They number each block inside the definition in execution order and describe the final state. This builds mental models of how custom block definitions execute before students create their own.

Assessment example: Given `define (Greet)` with `say [Hello]`, `wait 1 seconds`, `say [Goodbye]`, students number blocks 1-3 and describe: "First says Hello, waits 1 second, then says Goodbye."

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Experiment with pre-made custom blocks to observe parameter effects
Description: Students use an existing custom block (e.g., `call DrawRectangle [50] [30]` or `call MoveSprite [100] [200]`) provided in a starter project, and experiment with different argument values to see how the block's behavior changes. They learn that arguments (values in square brackets when calling) let one block handle many situations. Students do not create the block themselves yet; they explore how calling a pre-made block with different values produces different results.

Assessment example: Given a starter project with `call DrawShape [sides] [size]`, students try different values like `call DrawShape [3] [50]` for a triangle and `call DrawShape [6] [30]` for a hexagon, observing how the same block creates different shapes.

Dependencies:

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify repeated or grouped actions that could become custom blocks
Description: Students examine a longer script (15-30 blocks) that is ALREADY WRITTEN and identify groups of blocks that appear multiple times OR represent distinct behaviors. They draw boxes around these groups and label each with a descriptive name (e.g., "ResetPlayer," "CheckWinCondition"). This builds the habit of recognizing natural custom block boundaries IN EXISTING CODE before actually creating them. This is ANALYSIS of existing code, as opposed to DESIGN before coding (covered in G5.01.01).

Assessment example: Given a 20-block script for a maze game, students circle and label groups like "move character," "check wall collision," and "update score display," explaining why each group makes sense as a potential custom block.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.11: Experiment with pre-made custom blocks to observe parameter effects
* T09.G3.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
* T08.G3.03: Pick the right conditional block for a scenario

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify reporter blocks in existing code
Description: Students learn to recognize reporter blocks (blocks with rounded shapes that fit inside input slots) versus command blocks (blocks that perform actions and stack vertically). Using existing CreatiCode projects, they identify reporter blocks like `(pick random 1 to 10)`, `(distance to [sprite])`, or `(x position)` and observe where these blocks can be used (inside input slots of other blocks). This prepares students to understand return values from custom reporter blocks in later grades.

Assessment example: Given 10-12 different blocks from various categories, students sort them into "reporter blocks" (rounded, return a value) and "command blocks" (rectangular, do an action) and show one example of where each type can be used in a script.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.12: Identify repeated or grouped actions that could become custom blocks
* T09.G3.04: Debug a single missing or wrong variable block
* T07.G3.04: Use repeat-until to reach a simple goal

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Navigate the "Make a Block" interface and create empty blocks
Description: Students open CreatiCode's "My Blocks" category, click "Make a Block," and navigate the basic interface. They type a simple block name (without parameters, like "ResetGame" or "JumpUp") and observe the preview of how the block will look. After clicking OK, they see the `define (ResetGame)` hat block appear, understanding this is where they add the block's code. They practice this process 2-3 times with different names.

Assessment example: Students open the "Make a Block" dialog, type three different simple block names ("StartGame", "ShowMenu", "PlaySound"), observe each preview, click OK to see the define block appear, and explain what the define block is for.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Add one parameter to a custom block interface
Description: Students extend their exploration of the "Make a Block" interface by adding a single parameter. They click "Add an input number or text," name the parameter (e.g., "size"), see it appear in the block preview as `myBlock [size]`, and understand this placeholder will accept a value when the block is called. They do not implement the block's behavior yet—just practice creating the interface.

Assessment example: Students create three custom block interfaces with one parameter each: "DrawCircle [radius]", "Jump [height]", "SetSpeed [speed]". They explain what each parameter represents.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.14: Navigate the "Make a Block" interface and create empty blocks

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Create a custom block with one number parameter
Description: Students define a complete custom block with one number parameter and implement its behavior. For example, they create `define (DrawSquare [size])` and use the [size] parameter inside the block definition (e.g., in `move [size] steps`). They test the block with different values, verifying that `call DrawSquare [50]` creates a different size square than `call DrawSquare [100]`.

Assessment example: Students create a "DrawSquare [size]" custom block, use the parameter to control side length, and test with 3 different values to verify it works correctly.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.15: Add one parameter to a custom block interface
* T07.G4.03: Use a variable as the loop counter

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Call a custom block with different parameter values
Description: Students call their parameterized custom block multiple times with different values to accomplish different tasks. For example, after creating "DrawSquare [size]", they write a script that calls `DrawSquare [30]`, `DrawSquare [50]`, `DrawSquare [70]` to draw three squares of increasing size. This demonstrates the reusability and flexibility of parameterized blocks.

Assessment example: Students create a pattern or animation by calling the same custom block 3-5 times with different parameter values.

Skill: Replace hard-coded values with parameters
Description: Students take an existing custom block with hard-coded values and refactor it to use parameters instead, making it more flexible. For example, they transform `define (DrawTriangle)` with `move 50 steps` into `define (DrawTriangle [size])` with `move [size] steps`. They compare the original and refactored versions and explain the benefits of using parameters.

Assessment example: Given a custom block with 2-3 hard-coded values, students identify which values should become parameters, add the parameters, and replace the hard-coded values with parameter references.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Compose built-in reporter blocks in expressions and conditions
Description: Students use built-in reporter blocks (rounded blocks that return values) inside other blocks, building more complex expressions. For example, they use `(pick random 1 to 10)` inside `move ( ) steps`, or `(distance to [sprite])` inside an if condition `< (distance to [sprite]) < [50] >`. They recognize that reporter blocks can be nested and combined to create sophisticated behaviors.

Assessment example: Students create scripts that use at least 3 different reporter blocks in various contexts: in motion blocks, in operators, and in conditionals.

Skill: Organize a project with 3-4 custom blocks
Description: Students decompose a project into 3-4 distinct custom blocks, each with a clear responsibility. For example, a simple game might have "SetupGame", "UpdateScore [points]", "CheckWinCondition", and "ResetLevel". They implement all blocks and coordinate them in a main script. This builds project organization skills.

Assessment example: Students create a complete project using 3-4 custom blocks, each documented with a purpose comment, and explain how the blocks work together.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Add a boolean parameter to control block behavior
Description: Students create a custom block with a boolean (true/false) parameter that controls conditional behavior inside the block. For example, `define (MoveFigure [shouldJump])` uses an if block to check the parameter: `if <[shouldJump]> then [jump animation] else [walk animation]`. They call the block with both true and false to see different behaviors.

Assessment example: Students create a custom block with a boolean parameter, implement conditional logic based on the parameter, and demonstrate calling it with both true and false values.

For example, three different "Draw" blocks might all start with "pen down" and end with "pen up". They highlight shared code and consider whether it should be extracted into its own block. This introduces the concept of factoring out common code.

Assessment example: Given three custom blocks, students highlight code that appears in multiple blocks and explain what benefits extracting it would provide.

Skill: Call one custom block from inside another
Description: Students create custom blocks that call other custom blocks, building hierarchical organization. For example, `define (DrawHouse)` might call `DrawRectangle [100] [80]` and `DrawTriangle [100]` to compose a house from simpler shapes. This demonstrates how complex behaviors can be built from simpler building blocks.

Assessment example: Students create 3 custom blocks where at least one block calls another custom block in its implementation, and explain how this organization makes code easier to understand.

Skill: Trace execution through nested custom block calls
Description: Students trace step-by-step through a script that calls a custom block which itself calls other custom blocks. They create an execution trace showing the order of operations: main script → first custom block → nested custom block → back to first custom block → back to main script. This builds understanding of the call stack concept at an intuitive level.

Assessment example: Given a main script that calls "DrawHouse" which calls "DrawRectangle" and "DrawTriangle", students create a numbered trace showing all blocks executed in order, including which custom block they're inside at each step.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Extract repeated code into a helper custom block
Description: Students identify code that appears in multiple places and extract it into a new "helper" custom block that is called from the original locations. For example, if three custom blocks all have identical setup code, they create a "DoSetup" helper block and call it from all three. This is practical refactoring.

Assessment example: Students find code repeated in 2-3 places, extract it into a new helper block, replace the original code with calls to the helper, and verify the program still works.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Create a custom reporter block
Description: Students create custom blocks that RETURN values (reporter blocks) instead of just performing actions. In CreatiCode, they use the "Add an input number or text" option in the "Make a Block" dialog and implement logic that produces a result. For example, `define (CalculateScore [points] [multiplier])` returns `([points] * [multiplier])`. They understand the difference between command blocks (do actions) and reporter blocks (return values).

Assessment example: Students create a custom reporter block that performs a calculation or returns information, and use it in at least two different contexts (e.g., in a variable assignment and in a conditional).

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.08: Create a custom block with two parameters
* T10.G5.01: Calculate with arithmetic expressions (nested operators)

ID: T11.G5.02.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Distinguish when to use reporter vs command custom blocks
Description: Students decide whether new custom blocks should be reporters (return a value) or commands (perform an action). They recognize that reporters are appropriate when you need to calculate or retrieve information, while commands are for performing actions with side effects. Given scenarios, they choose the appropriate block type and explain their reasoning.

Assessment example: Given 6-8 block descriptions, students categorize each as better implemented as a reporter or command block and explain why (e.g., "CalculateDistance" → reporter because it computes a value; "MoveTo" → command because it changes sprite position).

ID: T12.G5.13
Topic: T12 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Explain bug causation using cause-effect chain reasoning
Description: Students practice **causal reasoning** for bugs by constructing cause-effect chains. Given a symptom (e.g., "sprite disappears off screen"), they trace backward: (1) **Immediate cause**: sprite x > 240, (2) **Prior cause**: move block adds 100 each time, (3) **Root cause**: no boundary check before moving. They write chains like: "The sprite disappears [EFFECT] because x exceeds 240 [CAUSE] because move block runs in forever loop without check [ROOT CAUSE]."

Skill: Program horizontal movement with arrow keys
Description: Build sprite movement using `when [left arrow] key pressed` with `change x by (-10)` for left, and `when [right arrow] key pressed` with `change x by (10)` for right. **How it works:** Each key press triggers the change-by block once, moving sprite 10 pixels. Holding the key triggers repeated events (automatic repeat). **Test your code:** Verify sprite moves equal distances left and right, responds immediately to key presses. **Debug tips:** If sprite only moves once per key press, ensure you're holding the key. If sprite moves wrong direction, check positive/negative values (negative x = left, positive x = right). _CSTA: 2-AP-10._

Skill: Program 4-directional movement with arrow keys
Description: Extend horizontal movement by adding vertical controls: `when [up arrow] key pressed` with `change y by (10)` and `when [down arrow] key pressed` with `change y by (-10)`. **Coordinate system:** Positive y = up (toward top of screen), negative y = down (toward bottom). **Test your code:** Press each arrow key to verify all four directions work correctly. Test diagonal movement by pressing two keys simultaneously (up + right should move diagonally). **Total setup:** 4 separate `when key pressed` scripts, one for each arrow key. This 4-directional control is standard for top-down games like maze or exploration games. _CSTA: 2-AP-10._

Skill: Debug and tune movement speed
Description: Test different step values in `change x by` and `change y by` blocks to find the right movement speed for your game. **Experiment:** Try values 5, 10, 15, 20 and observe the difference. **Game type guidelines:** Maze games → slower (5-8 steps) for precise navigation; Action games → faster (10-15 steps) for responsive feel; Racing games → very fast (15-25 steps). **Debug scenario:** Movement feels sluggish → increase step value; Player overshoots targets → decrease step value. **Testing process:** Change value, play test, observe, adjust, repeat until movement feels right. This iterative tuning is essential game design skill. _CSTA: 2-AP-17._

Skill: Detect collision with goal sprite
Description: Use `if <touching [Goal]?> then` block inside a `forever` loop to continuously check if player reaches the goal. **How collision detection works:** The `touching?` block returns true when any part of player sprite's visible pixels overlap with any part of Goal sprite's visible pixels. **Implementation:** `forever { if <touching [Goal]?> then { say [You Win!] for (2) seconds } }`. **Test your code:** Move player to touch goal from different directions (left, right, above, below) to verify detection works from all angles. **Common issue:** If goal has transparent pixels in costume, collision only triggers on visible parts. _CSTA: 2-AP-13._

Skill: Initialize 2D physics world with gravity
Description: Use the `initialize 2D physics world with gravity x [0] y [-10]` block to enable the built-in physics engine. **Gravity values:** y=-10 creates normal downward gravity (like Earth), y=0 creates zero gravity (space), y=10 creates upward gravity (reverse). x values create sideways pull. **Important:** This block must run once at project start before any physics bodies are created. Place in `when green flag clicked` script. **Test:** After initialization, sprites with physics bodies should fall downward. Uses physics2d_initworld block. _CSTA: 2-AP-13._

Topic: T13 – 2D Games
Skill: Lock viewport to player sprite for camera following
Description: Use `lock viewport to this sprite with padding x [0] y [0]` block to make the camera automatically follow the player sprite. **How it works:** The stage view automatically pans to keep the sprite centered (or offset by padding values). **Advantage over manual camera:** No need to move all other sprites - the viewport handles scrolling automatically. **Padding:** x/y padding offsets the sprite from center (e.g., x=100 keeps player on left side of screen). **Test:** Move player around a large level and verify camera follows smoothly. Uses motion_lockviewport block. _CSTA: 2-AP-13._

ID: T14.G3.00.01
Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Identify sprite visual properties and predict changes
Description: Identify that sprites have three key visual properties that can be changed with code: **size** (how big/small, measured in percent where 100% is normal), **position** (where on stage, measured in x and y coordinates), and **visibility** (shown or hidden). Predict how a sprite will look when these properties change. Example: "If size changes from 100% to 50%, the sprite appears half as big. If `hide` runs, the sprite becomes invisible." This foundational understanding prepares you to use blocks that modify these properties.

ID: T14.G3.00.02
Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Use size blocks to scale sprites larger or smaller
Description: Use `set size to (100) %` to set a sprite's size to an exact percentage (100% = original size, 50% = half size, 200% = double size). Use `change size by (10)` to increase size by 10% from current value, or `change size by (-10)` to decrease. Trace what happens: if a sprite starts at 100% and `change size by (20)` runs, the sprite becomes 120%. Use size changes to create visual emphasis (make important characters larger), show distance (smaller = farther away), or prepare for size animations.

Skill: Edit sprite costumes using the paint editor tools
Description: Access the paint editor by clicking the "Costumes" tab for any sprite. Use the visual design tools to manually customize sprite appearances: **brush** for freehand drawing, **circle/oval** for round shapes, **rectangle/square** for boxes, **text** tool for adding words, **fill** for coloring areas, and **eraser** for removing parts. These manual edits become the sprite's permanent appearance and are saved with the project. The paint editor is a design tool (not coding) - you create costumes before running code. Multiple costumes on a sprite enable costume-switching animations. Later skills teach programmatic drawing with code blocks.

ID: T14.G3.01
Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Position sprites instantly with go to x y blocks
Description: Use `go to x: (0) y: (0)` to instantly teleport a sprite to specific stage coordinates (no animation - instant jump). **Coordinate system:** (0, 0) is stage center, positive X moves right (up to 240), negative X moves left (down to -240), positive Y moves up (up to 180), negative Y moves down (down to -180). Trace examples: `go to x: (100) y: (50)` places sprite in upper-right area. `go to x: (-150) y: (-100)` places sprite in lower-left area. Use this block to set starting positions or instantly reposition characters during scene changes.

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Animate smooth movement with glide blocks
Description: Use `glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (50)` to animate a sprite smoothly moving to a target position over a specified duration. Unlike `go to x: y:` which teleports instantly, glide creates visible motion animation. **Duration controls speed:** 0.5 secs = fast/snappy, 1-2 secs = normal, 3+ secs = slow/dramatic. Trace the animation: sprite smoothly slides from current position to target over the duration. Chain multiple glides to create paths: `glide (1) secs to x: (0) y: (0)` then `glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (0)` creates an L-shaped path. Use for character walking, flying, approaching, or any animated movement.

Dependencies:

ID: T14.G3.02
Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Create size animation using repeat loops
Description: Combine `change size by (10)` inside a `repeat` loop to create smooth grow/shrink animations. Trace this script: `repeat (10) { change size by (5) }` - the sprite grows by 5% ten times, ending 50% larger. For shrinking, use negative values: `repeat (10) { change size by (-5) }`. Add `wait (0.1) seconds` inside the loop to control animation speed: shorter waits = faster animation. Debug common issues: animation too fast (add wait blocks), sprite gets too big (reduce repeat count or size change amount), animation restarts at original size (need to reset size at start with `set size to (100) %`).

Dependencies:
* T14.G3.00.02: Use size blocks to scale sprites larger or smaller
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop





ID: T14.G3.02.01
Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Create frame-by-frame animation with costume switching
Description: Use `switch costume to [costume2 v]` to change a sprite to a specific costume, or `next costume` to cycle through all costumes in order (loops back to first after last). Create frame-by-frame animations by combining costume changes with loops and waits: `repeat (8) { next costume, wait (0.1) seconds }` creates an 8-frame animation cycling at 10 fps. Design multi-costume sprites for: walking cycles (4+ leg positions), talking mouths (open/closed), blinking eyes (open/half/closed), or transformation sequences. Trace a 4-costume walk cycle: costume1 (left foot) → costume2 (center) → costume3 (right foot) → costume4 (center) → repeats.

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Initialize sprite properties at project start
Description: Build initialization scripts that reset sprite properties at the start of every project run using `when green flag clicked`. Include: `go to x: (startX) y: (startY)` to set starting position, `set size to (100) %` to reset size to normal, `show` to make sprite visible (in case it was hidden), `switch costume to [costume1 v]` to reset appearance. Debug problem: sprite appears in wrong spot when project restarts → add position initialization. Trace initialization order: when green flag clicked → set position → set size → show → ready for story. Initialization ensures your story starts the same way every time.

Skill: Display internal thoughts with think blocks
Description: Use `think [Hmm...] for (2) seconds text size (16) [#FFFFFFFF] background [#000000FF] edge [#FFFFFFFF]` to show internal monologue in cloud-shaped thought bubbles. Parameters work identically to say blocks. **Visual difference:** think bubbles have cloud shapes (thoughts), say bubbles have pointed tails (speech). Identify when to use each: `say` = words spoken aloud that others hear, `think` = private thoughts that only the audience sees. Use think for character reasoning ("I should go left..."), secret plans, reactions ("That was surprising!"), or narration. Trace a scene: character sees treasure → `think [Wow! I found it!]` (private reaction).

Skill: Sequence multiple say blocks for monologue
Description: Stack multiple `say` blocks in sequence to create a character monologue (one character speaking multiple lines). Each say block runs after the previous one finishes. Trace this sequence: `say [Hello!] for (2) secs`, `say [My name is Alex.] for (2) secs`, `say [Nice to meet you!] for (2) secs` - the character says three lines, each appearing for 2 seconds in order. Calculate total duration: 3 blocks × 2 seconds = 6 seconds total. Debug timing: if dialogue feels rushed, increase duration; if too slow, decrease it. Use monologues for introductions, explanations, or storytelling narration.

Skill: Use wait blocks to control timing between actions
Description: Use `wait (1) seconds` to pause script execution, creating deliberate timing gaps between actions. Trace: `glide (1) secs to x: 100 y: 0`, `wait (0.5) seconds`, `say [I made it!] for (2) secs` - sprite moves, pauses briefly, then speaks. **Timing uses:** dramatic pause before reveal, gap between character movements, delay before response. Calculate timing: `say` for 2 secs + `wait` 1 sec = 3 seconds before next action. Debug: animation feels too fast → add wait blocks; animation feels too slow → reduce wait duration. Short waits (0.2-0.5 secs) for transitions, longer waits (1-3 secs) for dramatic effect.

Skill: Position labels strategically for UI layout
Description: Plan label positions using stage coordinates (X: -240 to 240, Y: -180 to 180). **Standard positions:** top center (0, 150) for titles, top-left (-200, 150) for chapter/scene numbers, top-right (200, 150) for scores, bottom center (0, -150) for subtitles/instructions, bottom corners for status indicators. **Size guidelines:** short text (width: 150-200), long text (width: 300-400), single line (height: 30-50), multi-line (height: 60-100). Trace a title setup: `add label [Chapter 1] at X (0) Y (160) width (300) height (40)...` → centered title near top. Design a UI layout by planning where each label should appear.

Skill: Update label text dynamically during runtime
Description: Use `set value to [New Text] for widget [titleLabel v]` to change a label's text while the project runs. Trace: label shows "Chapter 1" → `set value to [Chapter 2] for widget [titleLabel v]` runs → label now shows "Chapter 2". Combine with variables: `set value to (join [Score: ] (score)) for widget [scoreLabel v]` displays current score. Update labels in response to events: `when I receive [NextChapter]` → `set value to [Chapter 2]...`. **Use cases:** changing titles between scenes, updating score displays, showing current speaker name, displaying status messages. Labels update instantly when set value runs.

Skill: Print temporary text on the stage layer
Description: Use `print [Hello World] at x (0) y (0) width (300) height (100) color [#2CADE5FF]` to draw text directly on the stage layer. **Label vs print:** labels are widgets (above sprites, interactive), print is drawn on stage layer (below sprites, non-interactive). Printed text stays until cleared or project stops. **Parameters:** text content, X/Y position, width/height for text wrapping, color (hex #RRGGBBAA). Trace: `print [Welcome!] at x (0) y (100)...` → text appears at upper center, behind any sprites. Use for: background annotations, floating messages, temporary instructions, or decorative text elements.

Skill: Print timed text and sprite-relative text
Description: Add duration to print blocks: `print [Ouch!] at x (0) y (50)... for (2) seconds` makes text auto-disappear after 2 seconds. Create floating text near sprites using sprite position reporters: `print [+10] at x (x position) y ((y position) + (50))... for (1) seconds` displays "+10" above the sprite for 1 second. Trace: sprite at (100, 0) → print uses (x position)=100 and (y position)+50=50 → text appears at (100, 50). **Note:** printed text stays at its original position even if sprite moves afterward (not attached to sprite). Use for: damage numbers, power-up notifications, temporary status indicators, floating rewards.

Skill: Clear printed text when scenes change
Description: Use `clear all my prints` to remove all text printed by the current sprite. Trace: sprite has printed 3 messages → `clear all my prints` → all 3 messages disappear. **Scope:** each sprite clears only its own prints. **Scene change pattern:** `when I receive [NewScene]` → `clear all my prints` → print new scene text. Debug: text from previous scene still visible → ensure `clear all my prints` runs at scene start. **Important:** hiding a sprite does NOT clear its prints - you must explicitly clear. For multi-sprite projects, have each sprite clear its own prints, or use broadcasts to coordinate clearing.

Skill: Combine size animation with hide/show for visual effects
Description: Build complex visual effects by combining size animation with visibility controls. **Appear effect:** `set size to (0) %`, `show`, `repeat (10) { change size by (10) }` - sprite starts invisible-sized, appears, grows to full size. **Disappear effect:** `repeat (10) { change size by (-10) }`, `hide` - sprite shrinks to nothing, then hides. **Pulse effect:** `repeat (3) { repeat (5) { change size by (5) }, repeat (5) { change size by (-5) } }` - sprite grows and shrinks 3 times. Debug: effect happens too fast → add `wait (0.05) seconds` inside loops. Trace the size values through each loop iteration.

Skill: Use broadcasts to coordinate scene changes across sprites
Description: Use `broadcast [Scene2]` to send a message that triggers scripts in ALL sprites that have `when I receive [Scene2]`. This is the key mechanism for scene changes in multi-sprite stories. **How it works:** one sprite broadcasts → ALL sprites with matching `when I receive` run their scripts simultaneously. Trace: SceneManager broadcasts "Scene2" → House sprite hides, Forest sprite shows, Character sprite moves to forest position. **Architecture:** each sprite handles its own response to scene broadcasts (show/hide/move/speak). Design scenes by planning what each sprite does when each scene broadcast is received.

Skill: Program individual sprite responses to scene broadcasts
Description: Build `when I receive [SceneName]` scripts in EACH sprite to control that sprite's behavior per scene. **Pattern for each sprite:** `when I receive [Scene1]` → show/hide, position, costume for Scene1; `when I receive [Scene2]` → show/hide, position, costume for Scene2. **Example - House sprite:** `when I receive [Scene1]` → `show`, `go to x: 0 y: -50`; `when I receive [Scene2]` → `hide`. **Example - Hero sprite:** `when I receive [Scene1]` → `show`, `go to x: -100 y: 0`; `when I receive [Scene2]` → `go to x: 50 y: 0` (moves but stays visible). Debug: sprite appears in wrong scene → check that it has `when I receive` blocks for all relevant scenes.

Skill: Change stage backdrop to match scene changes
Description: Use `switch backdrop to [Forest v]` to change the stage background image. The Stage is a special sprite that can have multiple backdrops (like costumes for sprites). Add backdrops via the Stage's "Backdrops" tab. **Coordinate with scenes:** in Stage scripts, add `when I receive [Scene2]` → `switch backdrop to [Forest v]`. Trace scene change: broadcast "Scene2" → sprites respond (show/hide/move) AND Stage responds (switches backdrop) → entire visual scene changes. Use `next backdrop` to cycle through backdrops in order. Design backdrops for each story location: house interior, forest, castle, etc.

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Control character visibility with hide and show blocks
Description: Use `hide` to make a sprite invisible and `show` to make it visible again. **Visibility vs deletion:** `hide` keeps the sprite in the project but invisible; you can show it again. Hidden sprites still run scripts but cannot be clicked. **Scene management pattern:** characters not in current scene should be hidden. Trace: `when I receive [Scene2]` → `hide` on Village sprite; `when I receive [Scene1]` → `show` on Village sprite. **Initialization:** at green flag, show sprites that should be visible in Scene1, hide sprites that shouldn't. Debug: sprite doesn't appear → check if `show` runs at the right time.

Description: Use `add textbox at X (0) Y (-50) width (200) height (30) as [nameInput]` to create a text input field where players can type responses. **Parameters:** X/Y position, width/height dimensions, widget name for reference. Textboxes allow players to enter their name, type answers, or input story choices. Trace: widget created → player types "Alex" in the textbox → text is stored in the widget. Position textboxes where players expect input fields (near prompts or instructions). Use descriptive widget names like "nameInput" or "answerBox" to keep code readable.

Skill: Show, hide, and remove widgets dynamically
Description: Control widget visibility: `show widget [nameInput v]` makes visible, `hide widget [nameInput v]` makes invisible (widget still exists, retains value), `remove widget [nameInput v]` permanently deletes widget. **Use cases:** hide textbox after player submits name, show choice buttons only when needed, remove widgets when changing scenes. Trace: `hide widget [nameInput v]` → textbox disappears but value still readable → `show widget [nameInput v]` → textbox reappears with same value. **Pattern:** create widgets at scene start, hide/show as needed, remove when no longer needed.

Skill: Read widget values into variables for story use
Description: Use `set [playerName v] to (value of widget [nameInput v])` to capture the player's text input into a variable. The `(value of widget [widgetName v])` reporter returns whatever text the player typed. Trace: player types "Alex" in textbox → `set [playerName v] to (value of widget [nameInput v])` → playerName variable now contains "Alex". Use the variable throughout your story: `say (join [Hello, ] (playerName))` outputs "Hello, Alex". **Timing:** read widget value AFTER player has entered their input (use button click or wait).

Use `when widget [btnLeft v] clicked` event to detect clicks and `broadcast [LeftPath]` to trigger that story branch. **Pattern for choices:** create 2+ buttons for options → each button's click handler broadcasts a different message → sprites respond to broadcasts with different story content. Trace: player clicks "Go Left" button → `when widget [btnLeft v] clicked` runs → `broadcast [LeftPath]` → all sprites with `when I receive [LeftPath]` execute their left-path scripts.

Skill: Coordinate multi-sprite dialogue with synchronized waits
Description: Create back-and-forth conversations by synchronizing wait blocks across sprites. **Pattern:** both sprites start on same event (green flag or broadcast) → Sprite A: `say [Hello!] for (2) secs` → Sprite B: `wait (2) secs`, `say [Hi there!] for (2) secs` → Sprite A: `wait (4) secs`, `say [How are you?] for (2) secs`. Trace timing: Sprite A speaks (0-2 sec), Sprite B waits then speaks (2-4 sec), Sprite A waits then speaks (4-6 sec). Calculate wait times: each sprite waits for total duration of all previous speeches. Debug: dialogue overlaps → increase wait times; gaps too long → decrease wait times.

Skill: Run parallel actions using multiple scripts on same sprite
Description: Add multiple `when green flag clicked` scripts to the SAME sprite to run actions simultaneously. **Script 1:** handles walking animation (glide + costume changes). **Script 2:** handles dialogue (say blocks). Both scripts run in parallel when green flag is clicked. Trace: green flag → Script 1 starts glide AND Script 2 starts speech → character walks AND talks at same time. **Use cases:** character moves while speaking, background music plays while story progresses, animation loops while player makes choices. Compare to sequential: stacking blocks in one script makes them run one after another; separate scripts make them run in parallel.

Skill: Design character arc with beginning, middle, and end states
Description: Plan how a character changes throughout the story using three distinct states. **Beginning state:** character's initial appearance, position, and behavior (Hero starts small, shy, in corner). **Middle state:** character transformation during challenges (Hero grows larger, gains confidence, moves to center). **End state:** character's final form after resolution (Hero at full size, bold costume, center stage). **Implementation:** use costume changes, size changes, position changes to visually represent character growth. Design a character arc document: list each state's visual properties, what triggers the transition, and what it means for the story. Trace: Beginning (size 80%, costume "shy") → Challenge completed → Middle (size 100%, costume "brave") → Final victory → End (size 120%, costume "hero").

Skill: Debug dialogue timing in multi-character scenes
Description: Identify and fix timing issues when multiple characters speak. **Common timing bugs:** characters speak simultaneously (missing wait blocks), gaps too long between speeches (wait values too high), character speaks before reaching position (animation and dialogue not synchronized). **Debug technique:** add temporary `print` statements showing variable values and timing markers: `print (join [Start: ] (timer))` at key points. **Trace example:** Character A speaks for 3 seconds, Character B should wait 3 seconds then speak. If B speaks at 2 seconds: increase B's wait. If B speaks at 5 seconds: decrease B's wait. **Systematic approach:** document expected timing (A: 0-3s, B: 3-6s, A: 6-8s), run project, note actual timing, identify discrepancy, adjust wait values.

Skill: Debug and test multi-sprite scene coordination
Description: Ensure smooth scene transitions by systematically checking all sprite responses. **Testing checklist per scene:** which sprites show, which hide, sprite positions, costume states, backdrop. **Common bugs:** sprite left visible in wrong scene (missing hide), sprite in wrong position (missing go to), backdrop doesn't change (Stage script missing). Use `broadcast [Scene] and wait` when the script needs to pause until all sprites finish their scene setup. **Debug strategy:** test each scene transition individually, verify every sprite's state after each broadcast. Plan scene coordination with a table: columns = scenes, rows = sprites, cells = show/hide/position.

Skill: Broadcast action events to coordinate group animations
Description: Use `broadcast [Dance]` to trigger the same animation across multiple sprites simultaneously. **Pattern:** one sprite broadcasts an action → all sprites with `when I receive [Dance]` run their dance animation. **Examples:** `broadcast [Celebrate]` makes all characters cheer; `broadcast [FreezeAll]` stops all character movement. Design coordinated group animations: each sprite has its own `when I receive [Dance]` script with character-specific dance moves, but all dance at the same time.

Skill: Use broadcast and wait for strict sequential timing
Description: Use `broadcast [Action] and wait` to pause the current script until ALL scripts triggered by that broadcast complete. **Compare:** `broadcast [Walk]` continues immediately (parallel); `broadcast [Walk] and wait` pauses until walking finishes (sequential). **Cutscene pattern:** `broadcast [HeroWalks] and wait`, `broadcast [HeroSpeaks] and wait`, `broadcast [VillainAppears] and wait` - each action completes before next begins. Trace: `broadcast [Walk] and wait` → current script pauses → Hero sprite's walk script runs (3 secs) → walk script ends → current script resumes → next block runs.

Skill: Simulate camera panning by moving all sprites together
Description: Create the illusion of camera movement by moving all sprites (and backdrop elements) in the opposite direction. **Camera pan right:** all sprites `change x by (-5)` - sprites move left, creating illusion camera moved right. **Implementation:** `broadcast [PanRight]` → each sprite has `when I receive [PanRight]` with `repeat (20) { change x by (-5), wait (0.05) }`. All sprites move together in sync. **Multi-layer parallax:** background sprites move less (change x by -2), foreground sprites move more (change x by -7) for depth illusion. Trace: camera "pans right" 100 pixels → all sprites end up 100 pixels left of where they started.

Skill: Understand and plan visual layer composition
Description: Identify the fixed layer order in CreatiCode: **back to front:** Stage backdrop → Printed text → Sprites → Widgets. Sprites have relative layers (changeable), but always appear behind widgets and above printed text. **Design implications:** use backdrops for scene backgrounds, print blocks for floating annotations (behind characters), sprites for characters/objects, widgets for UI buttons/labels (always in front). Predict visual overlap: a character sprite will always appear in front of printed text but behind buttons. Plan your visual composition by assigning elements to appropriate layers.

Use `go [forward v] (1) layers` to move up one layer relative to current, `go [backward v] (1) layers` to move down. **Initialization pattern:** at green flag, set each sprite's layer - background sprites `go to [back v] layer`, character sprites `go to [front v] layer`. Trace: SkySprite at back, TreeSprite in middle, HeroSprite at front → Hero appears in front of Tree, Tree in front of Sky.

Position (x, y) is center point. Combine shapes for patterns: `repeat (5)` with `draw oval...` and `change x by (30)` creates a row of circles. **Use cases:** status indicators (filled circles for hearts/lives), decorative patterns, dynamic icons.

Skill: Trace animation state through multiple frames
Description: Systematically track how sprite properties change during complex animations. **Tracing technique:** create a table with columns for frame number, x position, y position, size, costume, effects. Run animation step-by-step, record values at each key frame. **Using console logging:** add `print (join [Frame ] (join (frame) (join [ x=] (x position))))` inside animation loops. **Predicting outcomes:** given initial state and animation code, predict final state by tracing through each iteration. **Example trace:** Start: x=0, size=100. Loop 5 times: change x by 20, change size by -10. After loop: x=100, size=50. **Debug application:** animation ends in wrong state, trace reveals where calculation diverges from expectation. Use tracing to verify complex animations before adding more features.

Debug: sprites move at different speeds means verify all sprites use same step calculation; zoom looks off-center means ensure all sprites scale relative to stage center (0,0). Design modular camera system before adding cinematic effects.

Dependencies:
* T14.G5.17: Design visual transitions between scenes
* T14.G5.03: Simulate camera panning by moving all sprites together

Skill: Design branching story node data structures
Description: Plan nested list structures for branching narratives. **Node structure:** [nodeID, dialogueText, [[choice1Text, nextNodeID], [choice2Text, nextNodeID], ...]]. **Example:** ["start", "You're in a forest. Go left or right?", [["Go left", "leftPath"], ["Go right", "rightPath"]]]. **Design process:** diagram story branches on paper → assign unique IDs to each node → define node data → implement as nested lists. **Navigation:** store currentNodeID → find node with matching ID → display dialogue → show choices → player selects → update currentNodeID. Plan data structure thoroughly before coding.

Dependencies:
* T14.G7.03: Build automated dialogue system with speaker tags
* T10.G6.01: Use nested lists or tables for structured data





ID: T14.G8.01.01
Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Display story node content and choices
Description: Extract and display content from story nodes. **Display dialogue:** find current node → extract dialogue text (item 2) → display in textbox or say block. **Display choices:** extract choices list (item 3) → loop through choices → create button for each with choice text (item 1 of each choice). **Dynamic UI:** remove old choice buttons before creating new ones for current node. Trace: currentNodeID = "start" → find start node → display "You're in a forest..." → create "Go left" and "Go right" buttons.

Dependencies:
* T14.G8.01: Design branching story node data structures
* T14.G6.07: Display formatted text with rich textbox widgets





ID: T14.G8.01.02
Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Navigate story graph based on player choices
Description: Process player choice selection to navigate the story. **Pattern:** `when widget [choice1] clicked` → extract next node ID from choice data (item 2 of choice) → `set [currentNodeID v] to (nextID)` → call display function for new node. **Loop:** display node → player chooses → navigate to next node → display new node → repeat until ending. **Ending detection:** if choices list is empty, node is an ending. Trace: player clicks "Go left" → nextID = "leftPath" → currentNodeID = "leftPath" → display leftPath node.

Dependencies:
* T14.G8.01.01: Display story node content and choices

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Encode story state into save strings
Description: Serialize story state for saving/loading. **Encode pattern:** use joins with delimiter: `set [save v] to (join (nodeID) (join [|] (join (score) (join [|] (hasKey)))))` → "forest|50|true". **Save options:** cloud variable `set [☁ save v] to (saveData)` (persistent, requires account); display code for manual copy `say [Your code: ] (saveData)` (works offline). **What to save:** current node, score variables, inventory flags, important choices made. Design save data to capture complete game state with minimal string length.

Dependencies:
* T14.G8.01.02: Navigate story graph based on player choices
* T14.G7.02: Parse structured text using delimiter splitting

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Build collaborative multiplayer story with cloud variables
Description: Create shared storytelling experiences using cloud variables. **Shared story state:** use cloud variables `☁ currentScene`, `☁ storyChoices` to synchronize state across players. **Turn-based storytelling:** `☁ currentWriter` tracks who's writing; other players see updates in real-time. **Collaborative voting:** multiple players vote on story choices; most votes determine path: `change [☁ voteA v] by (1)`. **Real-time updates:** poll cloud variables to detect changes: `if <not <(☁ scene) = (lastScene)>>` then update display. **Conflict resolution:** use timestamps or player IDs to handle simultaneous edits. **Architecture:** one player hosts (makes decisions), others observe; or democratic voting on all choices. Design collaborative stories that remain coherent with multiple contributors.

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Design story template system for reusable narratives
Description: Create modular story templates that can be filled with different content. **Template structure:** define slots for character names, locations, objects, outcomes. **Data separation:** story template in one list (with placeholders like {HERO}, {VILLAIN}), content data in another list. **Template rendering:** replace placeholders with actual content: loop through template, find {PLACEHOLDER}, replace with value from content list. **Reusable components:** build library of scene templates (introduction, conflict, resolution) that can be combined differently. **User-generated stories:** let players fill in template slots to create their own stories using your narrative structure. **Benefits:** one story engine powers multiple narratives; easy to add new stories by defining content data. Design templates that produce coherent stories regardless of content filled in.

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Build interactive fiction with real-time AI narration
Description: Create open-ended interactive fiction where AI generates the narrative in real-time. **Game loop:** display current situation → player types action → AI generates outcome → update state → repeat. **Persistent world state:** track location, inventory, NPCs met, choices made in variables/lists. **AI prompt design:** include world state, allowed actions, narrative style in each prompt. **Example prompt:** "Setting: medieval fantasy. Player is in [location] with [inventory]. They said: [playerInput]. Describe what happens next in 2-3 sentences, second-person narrative." **Guardrails:** detect and handle out-of-bounds actions ("You can't fly in this story"); maintain consistency with established facts. **Save system:** serialize world state for save/load. Design AI prompts that produce engaging, consistent, interactive narratives.

ID: T14.G8.09
Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Design multi-modal storytelling combining text, voice, and visuals
Description: Orchestrate synchronized presentation across multiple modalities. **Modal coordination:** when dialogue displays, TTS speaks same text, character animation shows talking. **Timing synchronization:** TTS duration varies by text length; use TTS callback or estimate duration to sync animations. **Modal preferences:** let users choose preferred mode (text-only, audio-only, both); store preference variable. **Accessibility by design:** text for deaf users, audio for blind users, visuals for everyone. **Emotional enhancement:** match TTS parameters to text mood; sync background music to narrative beat; visual effects reinforce story moments. **Implementation pattern:** `broadcast [StoryMoment]` triggers: (1) text display, (2) TTS playback, (3) animation, (4) sound effects - all coordinated by timing variables. Design stories that leverage multiple modalities for maximum emotional impact and accessibility.

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Implement cinematic camera techniques in 2D stories
Description: Apply film camera techniques to enhance 2D storytelling. **Zoom effects:** all sprites scale up for "close-up" → emphasizes emotion; scale down for "wide shot" → shows environment. **Pan and tracking:** smooth sprite movement simulates camera following character. **Dutch angle:** rotate sprites slightly for tension/unease. **Shot composition:** apply rule of thirds by positioning key elements at intersection points (±80 x, ±60 y). **Cutaway technique:** briefly show reaction shots by hiding main action, showing observer sprite reaction, returning. **Shot sequence:** establishing shot (wide) → medium shot → close-up for emotional moments → back to medium. **Timing:** dramatic beats use slower transitions; action uses quick cuts. Design scenes thinking like a film director choosing camera angles.

Dependencies:
* T14.G7.08: Design camera movement systems for storytelling
* T14.G7.05: Design procedural animation sequences with mathematical patterns

Topic: T15 – User Interfaces
Skill: Create an interface that works on different screen sizes
Description: Create interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes using the "apply layout row" block. Define multiple rows with percentage heights summing to 100% (e.g., Row 1: 15% header, Row 2: 70% content, Row 3: 15% footer). Divide each row into cells with percentage widths (e.g., 20% 60% 20% for sidebar/content/sidebar). Widgets placed in cells automatically resize and reposition as screen size changes. The layout system eliminates manual coordinate calculations and makes your interface responsive on tablets, phones, and computers.

Skill: Explain how synchronization keeps multiplayer games consistent
Description: Students define "synchronization" as keeping the game state the same for all players. They describe how when one player moves their character, that movement must be sent to other players so everyone sees it in (nearly) the same position. They categorize data types: what needs synchronization (player positions, scores, game events, shared object states) versus what stays local (sound effects, local UI feedback, input hints). They trace what happens when synchronization fails (players see different game states, unfair outcomes, confusion). They explain why synchronization is challenging (internet messages take time to travel, players may have different internet speeds, messages can arrive in different orders).

Description: Students use "add sprite to game" blocks to register sprites so they appear on all connected players' screens. They configure sprites as Dynamic (positions synchronize continuously for moving objects like players or projectiles) or Static (positions fixed for non-moving objects like walls or platforms). They choose appropriate collision shapes (Rectangle for box-shaped, Circle for round objects) that match sprite appearance. They understand that registered sprites appear as "originals" on the registering player's screen and "replicates" on other players' screens. This enables shared game worlds where all players see the same objects.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Implement synchronized sprite movement
Description: Students use synchronized movement blocks (set speed x/y, glide to position) instead of regular movement blocks to make sprite movement appear on all players' screens. They understand that regular movement blocks only affect the local sprite while synchronized blocks broadcast position updates to all clients. They test with two windows to verify that movement in one window appears in the other. They explain why synchronized movement is necessary (so all players see the same positions) and why it must be used instead of regular movement (regular movement doesn't broadcast updates). This enables multiplayer games where players see each other move.

They send messages with parameters to share game events (player scored, item collected, round started). They implement "when I receive multiplayer message" listeners to react when messages arrive. They test with two windows to verify messages sent from one window trigger listeners in the other. They distinguish between regular broadcasts (only within one instance) and multiplayer broadcasts (across all connected instances). This enables custom event synchronization beyond automatic position updates.

Skill: Choose broadcast mode for different scenarios
Description: Students select the appropriate broadcast mode: "All Sprites" (message received by all sprites including replicates on all players' browsers) versus "Exclude Replicate" (only received by original sprites, not replicate sprites that mirror remote players). They explain when each mode is appropriate: "All Sprites" for global events affecting everyone, "Exclude Replicate" for owner-only actions. They test both modes and observe the difference in which sprites respond.

Skill: Test multiplayer games with multiple windows
Description: Students open two or more browser windows/tabs to test their multiplayer games as both host and client simultaneously. They create a game in one window, join from the other, and verify that actions in each window appear in the others (movement, messages, score changes, sprite appearances). They develop a systematic testing workflow: test alone first (both windows on same computer), then test with real partners (different computers with network delay). They understand that two-window testing simulates multiplayer but without realistic network lag. This establishes essential testing methodology for multiplayer development.

Skill: Access and display player information
Description: Students use "list players in game" to get a table of all connected players with their display names and roles. They use reporters to get their own player index, display name, and role. They display player information on screen (player count, names list, current player's name). They implement logic that uses player information (assign positions based on player count, check player roles to determine behaviors). They understand that player information updates when players join or leave. This enables games that adapt to the number and identity of connected players.

Skill: Build a simple synchronized multiplayer game
Description: Students design and implement a complete simple multiplayer game that combines all G5 multiplayer skills. They create/join game rooms, register and synchronize sprites, implement synchronized movement, broadcast custom events, and display player information. They choose a simple game concept (tag, racing, collection) that demonstrates synchronization. They test thoroughly with two windows and document what synchronizes (positions, messages) versus what stays local (UI, sounds). They gather feedback from a real partner (different computer) and reflect on how network delay affects gameplay. This synthesizes foundational multiplayer skills into a complete working game.

Skill: Trace how code runs on original versus replicate sprites
Description: Students explain that when a sprite is registered with the multiplayer game, the "original" exists on the registering player's computer and "replicates" automatically appear on all other players' screens. They understand that code blocks run only on the original by default (input controls should affect local sprite only, not remote replicates). They use print statements to trace which code runs on originals versus replicates. They explain why this separation prevents conflicts (multiple players trying to control the same sprite) and enables each player to control their own character while seeing others' characters as replicates.

Skill: Distinguish Dynamic versus Static sprites for performance
Description: Students classify game objects as Dynamic (moving objects like players, enemies, projectiles requiring continuous position synchronization) or Static (fixed objects like walls, platforms, decorations that never move and don't need synchronization). They understand the performance trade-off: Dynamic sprites synchronize smoothly but generate continuous network traffic, Static sprites are efficient but can't move. They audit their games to identify objects incorrectly classified and fix them. They categorize at least 10 different game objects with justification. This optimization reduces unnecessary network traffic and improves game performance.

Skill: Choose appropriate collision shapes for multiplayer sprites
Description: Students select collision shapes (Rectangle for box-shaped objects like walls and crates, Circle for round objects like balls and circular characters) that match sprite appearance for accurate hit detection. They understand that collision shapes must be consistent across all clients for fair gameplay. They test collision detection with both shapes and observe differences. They explain why shape choice matters for gameplay (accuracy, fairness, performance). They implement collision-based mechanics (goals, hazards, collectibles) using appropriate shapes. This ensures collision detection works correctly in the synchronized multiplayer environment.

Skill: Manage game rooms and server locations
Description: Students explain how CreatiCode game rooms exist on servers in different geographic locations (US-East, US-West, Europe, Asia). They understand that all players must connect to the same server to play together and that server location affects lag (closer servers = lower lag). They choose appropriate server locations based on where players are located. They use "list multiplayer games in server in table" to see active games and filter by server. They understand that game rooms are temporary (exist while players are connected) versus permanent (game doesn't save after all players leave). This enables informed decisions about server selection and room management.

Skill: Implement player roles and role-based logic
Description: Students assign roles to players (team names like "red" or "blue", job types like "builder" or "seeker", character classes like "wizard" or "warrior") when creating or joining games. They implement conditional logic that checks player roles and executes role-specific code (red team attacks blue base, builder can place blocks, seeker sees hints). They display role information to players so they know their assignments. They test with multiple players in different roles to verify each role behaves correctly. This enables asymmetric gameplay and team-based mechanics.

Description: Students use the "connected to game" boolean reporter to monitor connection state continuously. They display connection indicators (green checkmark when connected, red X when disconnected, yellow spinner when connecting). They disable game controls when disconnected to prevent errors from actions that require network communication. They implement reconnection prompts when connection drops. They test by simulating disconnections (closing/reopening window, network interruptions) and verifying appropriate feedback. This provides essential user feedback for network-dependent games.

Skill: Create shared world objects synchronized for all players
Description: Students implement game objects that exist in the shared world and affect all players (doors that open for everyone, collectibles that disappear when anyone takes them, hazards that damage any player). They use multiplayer broadcasts to synchronize object state changes across all clients (when one player opens door, broadcast "door opened" so all clients show open door). They ensure only one player can trigger one-time events (first player to collect item gets it, others' clients hide it). They test with multiple windows to verify shared objects stay synchronized. This enables rich interactive multiplayer environments.

Skill: Display synchronized scoreboards and game state
Description: Students create UI elements that display game state visible to all players (scoreboard showing all players' scores, timer counting down for everyone, team status, objective progress). They use multiplayer broadcasts to synchronize updates (when player scores, broadcast new score to all clients). They ensure UI updates are synchronized so all players see the same information simultaneously. They format scoreboards clearly with player names, scores, and rankings. They test to verify scoreboards update correctly on all clients when any player's state changes. This provides essential shared feedback in competitive multiplayer games.

Description: Students configure maximum player capacity when creating games and implement logic to handle full games gracefully. They check game user count before attempting joins and display "Game Full" messages when appropriate. They use the game list table to identify full games before trying to join. They implement waiting lists or queue systems for full games. They test by filling games to capacity and attempting additional joins. They explain why capacity limits exist (game balance, performance, server resources) and communicate them clearly to players. This prevents poor user experience from failed join attempts.

Skill: Distinguish display names from account names
Description: Students explain the difference between account names (private, used for login, tied to CreatiCode account), display names (public, shown to other players in games, can be changed), and game names (identifies specific game rooms). They understand that display names protect privacy by not revealing account information while still allowing player identification. They choose appropriate display names (clear, identifiable, not revealing personal information). They explain why these distinctions matter for both privacy and usability. This connects to digital citizenship and online safety while enabling multiplayer identity systems.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Explain lag and network latency effects
Description: Students explain that "lag" or "latency" is the delay between a player's action and when other players see it, caused by network message travel time. They understand that lag depends on physical distance to server, internet speed, and network congestion. They test games on different server locations and observe lag differences. They identify how lag affects different game types (fast-paced action games are very sensitive, turn-based games are less affected). They explain that some lag is unavoidable but can be minimized through good server selection and game design. This builds understanding of inherent networked systems constraints.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Compare automatic versus manual synchronization
Description: Students distinguish between automatic synchronization (synchronized movement blocks broadcast position updates continuously without manual coding) and manual synchronization (using multiplayer broadcast blocks to explicitly send custom messages for discrete events). They identify when to use each: continuous data like positions use synchronized movement blocks, discrete events like scoring or collecting use manual broadcasts. They understand trade-offs: automatic is easier but less flexible, manual requires more code but allows custom game events. They implement both types in the same game. This develops judgment about appropriate synchronization strategies.

Description: Students compare two approaches for online data sharing: multiplayer games (real-time synchronization through game servers, temporary game rooms, immediate updates, multiple simultaneous players) versus cloud variables (persistent database storage, slower async updates, no game rooms, data survives after players leave). They identify appropriate use cases: multiplayer for interactive real-time games with simultaneous players, cloud variables for leaderboards, saved progress across sessions, or asynchronous sharing. They understand technical differences: multiplayer uses game servers and rooms, cloud variables use database storage. They explain trade-offs between the two approaches.

Description: Students design and implement games where different roles have different abilities, objectives, or victory conditions (hide-and-seek where seekers see differently than hiders, team games where red defends while blue attacks, class-based games where wizard casts spells while warrior melees). They use role-checking conditionals to execute role-specific logic. They balance roles so no role has systematic advantage. They test with multiple players in different roles and gather feedback on balance and fun.

They test games on different servers (US-East, US-West, Europe, Asia) and measure/observe lag differences. They understand that players closer to the server experience lower lag. They make informed decisions: choose server closest to majority of players, or central location for distributed players. They explain trade-offs when players are geographically spread (some will experience more lag regardless of choice). They document server selection rationale for their games. This demonstrates advanced understanding of networked systems performance.

Skill: Design gameplay that accounts for network delay
Description: Students understand that network delay causes actions to appear delayed on other players' screens and design gameplay that tolerates this delay. They avoid requiring frame-perfect timing or instant reactions. They provide visual feedback for actions so players know their input was registered even before seeing results. They test with real network delay (different computers, distant servers) and observe delay effects on gameplay. They identify which game types tolerate delay better (turn-based, slower-paced) versus which are sensitive (fast-paced action, precise timing). They iteratively refine gameplay to reduce delay frustration. This demonstrates sophisticated understanding of networked systems constraints.

The host monitors player ready status and starts the game only when all connected players have marked themselves ready. They display ready status for all players so everyone can see who's waiting. They allow players to un-ready and implement countdown timers before start. They test with multiple windows to verify game doesn't start prematurely. They explain why ready systems improve multiplayer experience (ensures everyone is prepared, prevents unfair starts, allows time for players to join and configure). This creates polished multiplayer game experiences.

Description: Students design and implement games that work correctly with any number of players (2, 3, 4, or more) without hardcoding specific player counts. They loop over the player list when creating sprites, distributing objectives, or updating displays. They use player list length to determine actual player count and adjust game parameters accordingly (spawn point distribution, team sizes, resource allocation). They test with different player counts (2, 3, 4, 5+) to verify scalability. They explain why scalable design matters (reusability, flexibility, better player experience across group sizes). This demonstrates professional-level game architecture thinking.

They ensure starting conditions are equidistant from objectives, team assignments are balanced, and scoring doesn't favor specific roles or positions. They test with multiple players, record outcomes, and use data to identify imbalances. They iteratively adjust parameters and re-test to verify improved balance. They explain why fairness is critical for competitive multiplayer (player satisfaction, replay value, perceived legitimacy, community building). This demonstrates game design sophistication and playtesting methodology.

Skill: Choose what data to synchronize versus keep local
Description: Students make informed decisions about which game data should synchronize across all clients (scores, positions, game state, shared objects) versus stay local (UI state, sound effects, visual feedback, input buffering). They understand that over-synchronizing causes unnecessary network traffic and lag while under-synchronizing causes inconsistent game states across clients. They test by deliberately over/under-synchronizing and documenting problems. They develop judgment about synchronization trade-offs based on game requirements (what must be shared for fairness and consistency versus what can stay local for performance).

Skill: Implement host-authoritative validation to prevent cheating
Description: Students restructure games so clients request actions (score changes, movement, item collection) but only the host validates and applies them. The host checks if actions are legal (within game rules, physically possible, timing constraints met) and rejects impossible actions (teleporting, instant score, invalid moves, duplicate collections). They understand that client-side validation can be bypassed by modifying code but host validation maintains fair play. They test by attempting to cheat and verifying the host blocks invalid actions. They explain security benefits of host-authoritative architecture (prevents cheating, maintains game integrity, ensures fair competition). This introduces authoritative server concepts from professional game development.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Implement reconnection handling
Description: Students detect when players disconnect (intentionally or due to network issues) and implement reconnection logic.

They measure network traffic before and after optimization using timing and message counting. They understand trade-offs between update frequency and perceived lag (higher frequency smoother but more traffic, lower frequency less traffic but more stuttery).

## GRADE 6 SKILLS




ID: T22.G6.01.01
Topic: T22 – AI Perception
Skill: Capture a single spoken phrase with basic speech recognition
Description: Students use the basic speech recognition flow: `start recognizing speech in [English (United States) v] record as []` (with default language), wait briefly, then `end speech recognition` to capture a single spoken word or phrase. The recognized text is stored in a variable (not in a table). They display the result using the `text from speech` reporter block and a `say` block or variable monitor. Common issues include silent rooms (no input detected), background noise (mis-recognition), and recognition delay (typically 1-3 seconds after speaking stops). They learn the workflow: start detection → speak → wait for processing → end detection → read result. They understand that the system listens continuously while detection is active and that ending detection triggers the final transcription.

They track time since recognition started, and if no speech is detected within a threshold (e.g., 10 seconds), they automatically: (1) end recognition to prevent indefinite waiting, (2) display a timeout message, (3) offer alternatives (try again, type instead, cancel). They implement a visual countdown or progress indicator showing time remaining. They distinguish between "user hasn't spoken yet" (keep waiting with feedback) vs "recognition seems stuck" (timeout and recover).

They identify which row contains specific finger data and trace that curl ranges from 0° (fully closed/fist) to 180° (fully extended/straight), direction ranges from 0° to 360° indicating pointing direction, and x/y are screen coordinates while z is depth. They practice locating specific data: "Which row has index finger curl?" (row 2). IMPORTANT: Curl and dir values are ONLY available in rows 1-5 (finger summaries), NOT in the landmark rows.

For gesture detection, they check that a gesture is maintained for multiple consecutive frames (3+ frames) before triggering an action. This prevents false positives from brief sensor noise or accidental hand movements. They understand the trade-off between reliability and responsiveness.

Description: Students compare two detection patterns: (1) continuous polling in forever loop (constantly read table and update), (2) event-driven (start detection, wait for specific condition, then act). They implement both patterns with hand detection: continuous mode moves sprite smoothly following hand, event-driven mode triggers action when gesture detected. They discuss trade-offs: continuous is smooth but CPU-intensive, event-driven is efficient but may miss quick gestures.

Description: **Student task:** Find and fix the bug in a simulation that produces unfair results. **Buggy project:** Run the provided simulation 100 times—notice red appears ~50% instead of 25%. **Bug hunt:** Inspect the code. **Common bugs to look for:** (A) 'if roll = 1 OR roll = 2 then "red"'—red gets 2 chances out of 4, (B) 'pick random 1 to 3' but 4 outcomes mapped—one color never appears, (C) Missing 'else if' causing fall-through. **Debugging process:** (1) Trace through code with sample values (roll=1, roll=2, etc.), (2) Count how many roll values lead to each color, (3) Find the mismatch. **Fix:** Modify code so each color gets exactly 1 chance. **Verification:** Run 100 trials—percentages should now be roughly 25% each. **Success criteria:** Identify the specific bug, fix it correctly, verify with test run. _Implementation note: Pre-built buggy project with debugging hints._

(Spread out fairly evenly), (2) "Are there any big empty gaps?" (Usually not, but possible by chance), (3) "Run it again—do you get the same pattern?" (No—different random coordinates each time). **Key concept:** Random 2D coordinates fill space uniformly—this is the foundation for Monte Carlo simulations! **Success criteria:** Generate 50 visible dots that appear distributed across the stage. _Implementation note: Clear stage before stamping; use small dot costume._

Description: **Student task:** Practice converting probability expressions between different forms. **Conversion examples:** (A) Fair 6-sided die: "chance of rolling 3" = 1 out of 6 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167 ≈ 16.7%, (B) 4-color spinner: "chance of red" = 1 out of 4 = 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%, (C) Bag with 3 red, 2 blue: "chance of red" = 3 out of 5 = 3/5 = 0.6 = 60%. **Practice problems:** (1) "2 out of 5 chance of rain"—what percentage? (40%), (2) "75% chance of success"—what fraction? (3/4), (3) "0.1 probability"—what percentage? (10%). **Connection to simulation:** Compare theoretical values (calculated) to experimental results (from your simulation).

Description: **Student task:** Create a simulation that picks items randomly without repeats—like dealing cards or choosing team captains. **Build steps:** (1) Create list of items: ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eve"], (2) 'repeat 5 times', (3) 'set index to pick random 1 to length of [names]', (4) 'say item (index) of [names]' (display the pick), (5) 'delete item (index) from [names]' (remove so it can't be picked again). **Verification:** (1) Run it—each name should appear exactly once, (2) After all picks, list should be empty, (3) No name should repeat. **Real-world connections:** Card dealing, lottery drawings, random team assignment. **Key concept:** This is "sampling without replacement"—once picked, an item is gone. **Success criteria:** All 5 names picked exactly once, list empty at end, no repeats. _Implementation note: Visual list showing items being removed as picked._

Description: **Student task:** Create visual area models to represent and calculate probabilities. **Build steps:** (1) Draw a square on stage (200×200 pixels), (2) Divide it into sections proportional to probabilities, (3) Color each section differently. **Example 1:** Fair die—divide square into 6 equal vertical strips. Each has area = 1/6 of total. **Example 2:** Weighted spinner (50% red, 30% blue, 20% green)—divide square: red gets half (100×200), blue gets 30% (60×200), green gets 20% (40×200). **Connection to simulation:** Generate 100 random points in the square. Count how many land in each region. Does the count match the area proportion? **Analysis question:** "If red is 50% of the area, about how many of 100 random points should land in red?"

The possible sums (2-12) don't all have equal chances! **Preview question:** "Do you think 7 and 2 are equally likely? We'll find out in the next skill." **Success criteria:** Collect 200 valid sums (all between 2-12). _Implementation note: Dual die visualization showing each roll before adding to list._

Skill: Analyze compound event distributions and explain why 7 is most common
Description: **Student task:** Count frequencies for each sum (2-12) from your two-dice data and explain the pattern. **Analysis steps:** (1) Create counters for each sum (2 through 12), (2) Loop through sums list counting each, (3) Create bar chart showing frequency of each sum. **Key observation:** 7 appears most often! **Explanation:** Count the ways to make each sum: Sum 2 = 1 way (1+1), Sum 7 = 6 ways (1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1), Sum 12 = 1 way (6+6). **Fill in table:** "How many ways to make sum 3?" (2 ways: 1+2, 2+1), "How many ways to make sum 6?" (5 ways). **Key concept:** Compound events aren't equally likely even when individual events are equal—more combinations = higher probability! **Success criteria:** Create accurate frequency chart, explain why 7 is most common using combination counting. _Implementation note: Interactive combination counter alongside bar chart._

(Ensures groups are similar, no bias in who gets which treatment), (2) "If you got 60 A's and 40 B's, is the code broken?" (Probably not—that's within normal random variation for 100 trials). **Real-world connection:** Medical trials, website testing, psychology experiments all use random assignment. **Success criteria:** Create working random assignment, verify roughly equal groups, explain importance. _Implementation note: Visual split showing two groups filling up._

Skill: Use Monte Carlo sampling to estimate π
Description: **Student task:** Estimate the area of a circle (and π!) using random points. **Setup:** Square from -100 to 100 (side = 200), circle with radius 100 centered at origin. **Build steps:** (1) 'repeat 1000 times', (2) 'set x to pick random -100 to 100', (3) 'set y to pick random -100 to 100', (4) 'if (x*x + y*y) < 10000 then change hits by 1' (point inside circle), (5) 'change total by 1'. **Calculation:** Circle area / Square area = π×100² / 200² = π/4. So π ≈ 4 × (hits/total). **Expected result:** With 1000 points, estimate π ≈ 3.14 (±0.1 usually). **Visualization:** Color hits green (inside circle), misses red (outside). **Key concept:** Random sampling can solve geometry problems!

(Random variation—each run is different), (2) "Will they ever match exactly?" (Rarely—randomness almost always causes some difference), (3) "What happens with more trials?" (Experimental gets closer to theoretical). **Try it:** Run with 100 trials, then 1000 trials. Which is closer to 50%? **Key concept:** Experimental probability is what we OBSERVE; theoretical is what we EXPECT.

Description: **Student task:** Organize simulation results into a frequency table and histogram, then analyze the distribution. **Procedure:** (1) Run 100 die rolls, (2) Create frequency table: Value | Count (1|___, 2|___, ... 6|___), (3) Create histogram/bar chart from table. **Analysis questions:** (1) "What is the mode (most common value)?" (2) "What is the range?" (1 to 6), (3) "Is the distribution 'flat' (uniform) or 'peaked'?" (Should be roughly flat for fair die). **Comparison:** For a fair die, expect each value ~16-17 times out of 100. Is your distribution close? **Shape vocabulary:** Uniform = all bars roughly equal, Peaked = one value much higher, Skewed = bars slope in one direction. **Success criteria:** Create accurate frequency table and histogram, correctly identify mode and distribution shape. _Implementation note: Interactive histogram builder with distribution shape identifier._

(Varies—that's randomness!), (2) "Run it 5 times—do you get the same path?" (No—each run is different). **Key concept:** This is an "agent-based" simulation—the agent has state and makes probabilistic decisions. **Success criteria:** Walker completes 50 steps, trail is visible, energy depletes correctly. _Implementation note: Pen trail with energy counter display._

E = (10×0.5) + (0×0.5) = $5. **Example 3:** Weighted game: 10% chance win $100, 90% chance lose $5. E = (100×0.1) + (-5×0.9) = 10 - 4.5 = $5.50. **Verification:** Run 1000 simulations, calculate average outcome. Compare to calculated E. **Key insight:** Expected value tells you what to expect ON AVERAGE over many trials—not what happens in any single trial. **Success criteria:** Calculate E for 3 scenarios, verify one with simulation (average within 10% of E). _Implementation note: Calculator for E with simulation verification tool._

Skill: Identify independent events and debunk the gambler's fallacy
Description: **Student task:** Explore whether past results affect future outcomes in random events. **Simulation experiment:** (1) Run coin flip simulation that tracks streaks, (2) After getting 5 heads in a row, predict: Is tails now more likely? (3) Continue flipping 100 more times after a streak of 5 heads, (4) Count: What fraction were tails? **Key discovery:** Still ~50%! Each flip is INDEPENDENT—the coin has no memory of past flips. **Gambler's fallacy examples:** (A) "Red has come up 10 times at roulette, so black is due!" (WRONG), (B) "I've lost 5 games, so I'm due for a win!" (WRONG for random games), (C) "This lottery number hasn't won in years, it's overdue!"

Description: **Student task:** Run simulations at increasing sample sizes and observe convergence to theoretical probability. **Experiment:** Run coin flip simulations with n = 10, 100, 1000, 10000 trials. Record % heads for each. **Expected pattern:** n=10: might get 30-70% (high variability), n=100: usually 40-60%, n=1000: usually 47-53%, n=10000: usually 49-51% (very close to 50%). **Visualization:** Plot percentage vs trial count on line graph. The line should stabilize around 50% as n increases. **The Law of Large Numbers:** As the number of trials increases, experimental probability approaches theoretical probability. **Discussion:** "Does this mean that after many heads, tails becomes more likely?" (NO! That's the gambler's fallacy. The law says the AVERAGE stabilizes, not that results 'even out'). **Success criteria:** Complete 4 runs at different n values, create convergence graph, explain the law correctly. _Implementation note: Running percentage display that updates during simulation._

Skill: Simulate dependent events where probabilities change
Description: **Student task:** Simulate drawing marbles without replacement and observe how probabilities change. **Setup:** Bag contains 5 red, 3 blue marbles (list: [R,R,R,R,R,B,B,B]). **First draw:** P(red) = 5/8 = 62.5%. If red drawn, remove it from list. **Second draw:** Now 4 red, 3 blue remain. P(red) = 4/7 = 57.1%. **Simulation comparison:** Run 1000 trials each: (A) WITHOUT replacement (remove drawn marble), (B) WITH replacement (put marble back). **Compare results:** Track P(both red). Without replacement: (5/8)×(4/7) ≈ 35.7%. With replacement: (5/8)×(5/8) = 39.1%. **Key concept:** In dependent events, the outcome of one event changes the probabilities for the next. This is the foundation of conditional probability! **Success criteria:** Simulate both scenarios, explain why probabilities differ, calculate theoretical values. _Implementation note: Visual bag showing marbles being drawn and removed._

(Closer to goal, fewer obstacles), (2) "What's the theoretical maximum score from position (4,4) if goal is (5,5)?" (+10 goal - 2 steps = +8), (3) "Why might random movement give negative scores?"

Skill: Create two-sprite interaction with chase/flee dynamics
Description: **Student task:** Create two sprites that detect and respond to each other's positions. **Sprite behaviors:** Cat (predator): moves randomly each tick (pick random direction, move 5 pixels). Mouse (prey): 'if distance to cat < 50 then glide 10 pixels away from cat, else move randomly'. **Detection methods:** (A) 'touching [cat]?' block, (B) 'distance to [cat]' < threshold, (C) Calculate manually: sqrt((catX-mouseX)² + (catY-mouseY)²). **Game loop:** Both sprites update position each tick, creating emergent chase/flee dynamics. **Analysis:** Run for 100 ticks and count: How many times did cat catch mouse? Does mouse survive longer with better flee logic? **Key concept:** Multi-agent systems create emergent behavior—the chase pattern wasn't explicitly programmed, it emerges from individual rules! **Success criteria:** Both sprites move appropriately, mouse flees when cat is near. _Implementation note: Tick counter with catch detection._

Skill: Build a predator-prey simulation with probabilistic behaviors
Description: **Student task:** Build a predator-prey simulation where agents have probabilistic decision-making. **Predator behavior:** Each step: 70% chance move toward prey (calculate direction), 30% chance random move. Has "hunger" variable that increases each step, resets to 0 when catching prey, dies if hunger > 50. **Prey behavior:** Each step: if distance to predator < 100, flee (move away); else random move. Has "energy" that decreases by 1 each step, dies if energy = 0. **Simulation metrics:** Run 100 time steps, log: number of catches, average prey lifespan, predator hunger over time. **Analysis:** (1) "Does the prey always get caught?" (No—randomness means sometimes it escapes), (2) "What if predator is 90% vs 50% likely to chase?" (Higher = more catches, but more predictable). **Key concept:** Probabilistic rules create varied, realistic behaviors. **Success criteria:** Both agents have correct probabilistic behaviors, metrics logged correctly. _Implementation note: State variables for both agents with visual tracking._

Skill: Trace how an agent learns from rewards over multiple trials
Description: **Student task:** Observe and trace a pre-built "learning agent" simulation to understand reinforcement learning basics. **Agent setup:** Preference table stores direction weights for each grid cell. Initially: up=25%, right=25%, down=25%, left=25%. **Learning rule:** After reaching goal, trace back the successful path. For each cell on the path, increase weight of the direction taken by 10%. Normalize so weights sum to 100%. **Trace activity:** Run 10 trials, recording for cell (2,2): Trial 1 weights, Trial 5 weights, Trial 10 weights. **Analysis questions:** (1) "How did the preference table change?" (Successful directions get higher weights), (2) "Why does the agent take fewer steps by trial 10?" (It's learned which directions lead to goal), (3) "Is this 'intelligent'?" (It's learning from experience, a basic form of AI!). **Key concept:** This is reinforcement learning—the foundation of modern AI like game-playing bots. **Success criteria:** Accurately trace weight changes, explain why performance improves. _Implementation note: Visible preference table updating after each trial._

(Yes—skill should matter), (3) If new players score 0 and experienced score 100, is that fair? (Maybe not—game might be too punishing). **Additional test—Avatar bias:** Create players with different avatar types, same skill level. Do certain avatars get different outcomes? (If yes, that's unfair bias!). **Fairness questions:** "Should random elements affect skilled and new players equally?" "Should everyone have SOME chance to win?" **Success criteria:** Create test populations, run comparative analysis, identify fairness issues. _Implementation note: Population generator with group comparison stats._

Skill: Perform permutation tests to determine if differences are statistically meaningful
Description: **Student task:** Use shuffling to test whether an observed difference could happen by chance. **Scenario:** Version A scores: [85, 90, 88] (avg=87.7). Version B scores: [70, 75, 72] (avg=72.3). Real difference = 15.4 points. Is this meaningful or just random variation? **Permutation test procedure:** (1) Combine all scores into one pool: [85,90,88,70,75,72], (2) Shuffle the pool, (3) Split into fake "A" (first 3) and fake "B" (last 3), (4) Calculate fake difference in averages, (5) Repeat 200 times, (6) Count: How often is |fake difference| ≥ 15.4? **Interpretation:** If only 5 of 200 shuffles (2.5%) have difference ≥ 15.4, the real difference is unlikely to be chance. If 50 of 200 (25%) have difference ≥ 15.4, could easily be chance. **Key concept:** This is the foundation of statistical hypothesis testing—used by scientists to determine if results are "significant." **Success criteria:** Implement permutation test, interpret results correctly. _Implementation note: Shuffle animation with running count of extreme differences._

Graph population over time (line chart showing prey count vs predator count vs time). **Analysis questions:** (1) "Do prey cluster for safety?"

Description: **Student task:** Investigate how "random" selection can be unfair and learn to detect/fix biases. **Example 1—Biased pool:** Random from [A,A,A,B] gives 75% A, 25% B—the pool itself is biased, not the selection. Fix: Ensure equal representation in pool. **Example 2—Flawed shuffle (Fisher-Yates bug):** Swap with ANY position (biased) vs swap with LATER positions only (correct). Test: Run 10000 shuffles of [1,2,3], count how often each permutation appears. Correct algorithm gives ~1667 each; flawed gives unequal counts. **Historical case studies:** (A) 1970 Vietnam draft lottery—capsules not mixed well, later birthdays called more, (B) Early browser random number bugs exploited by online casinos. **Fixes:** Use verified library functions, audit distributions with many trials, use stratified selection when representation matters. **Success criteria:** Identify bias in 2+ scenarios, explain why they're biased, propose corrections. _Implementation note: Shuffle tester comparing biased vs correct algorithms._

Skill: Apply variance reduction techniques to improve simulation efficiency
Description: **Student task:** Learn and apply techniques to get accurate simulation results with fewer trials. **Problem:** Estimating probability of rare event (1%) with standard Monte Carlo requires 10,000+ trials for accuracy. **Technique 1—Stratified sampling:** Instead of fully random, ensure proportional sampling from known subgroups. Run both methods, compare variance. **Technique 2—Antithetic variates:** For each random number R, also use 1-R.

Compare standard deviation of estimates over 20 runs. **Analysis questions:** (1) "Why does stratified sampling reduce variance?"

Description: **Student task:** Leverage CreatiCode's 'set list to N random numbers with seed' block for efficient batch simulations. **Procedure:** (1) Generate 1000 random numbers with seed 42: 'set [randomList] to (1000) random numbers with seed (42)', (2) Use list values in simulation instead of calling pick random repeatedly, (3) Run same simulation on different seeds (42, 43, 44...) to create replications. **Advantages:** (A) Pre-generating is faster than per-trial generation, (B) Same seed = exact reproduction for debugging, (C) Different seeds = independent replications for statistics. **Experiment:** Run 100 trials each with seeds 1-20. Calculate mean and standard deviation of means across seeds. **The Central Limit Theorem:** Distribution of means is tighter than distribution of individual trials! **Analysis:** "Why do we run multiple seeds instead of one big run?" (Each seed is an independent experiment, giving us a sample of possible outcomes). **Success criteria:** Batch runs across 20 seeds, demonstrate mean convergence, explain CLT. _Implementation note: Use CreatiCode's seeded random list block._

ID: T28.G3.01
Topic: T28 – Text Data & NLP Foundations
Skill: Classify data types: text vs numbers vs images
Description: Students examine data examples and classify each as text, number, or image data type. They sort cards showing: "Hello World" (text), 42 (number), a photo (image), "3.14" (text—because it has quotes!), emoji 😀 (image), -17 (number). Key insight: the same characters can be different types—"42" in quotes is text (can't do math), 42 without quotes is a number. Students predict what happens when you try to add "5" + "3" (answer: "53" concatenation, not 8). This establishes that computers treat data differently based on type.
