ID: T07.G3.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use a counted repeat loop
Description: Students use their first `repeat N` loop to run a simple action a specific number of times (e.g., make a sprite say "Hello!" 3 times, or play a sound 2 times). This gateway skill introduces the fundamental concept of repetition in programming by replacing copied blocks with a single loop. Start with 2-3 repetitions and a single action inside. Students learn that `repeat 3` means "do this 3 times" - directly applying their K-2 understanding of counting repetitions.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T07.G2.04: Build a repeating picture sequence from instructions





ID: T07.G3.02
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace a script with a simple repeat loop
Description: Students read a script with a single `repeat N` loop (N = 2-4) and predict the outcome. Example: `repeat 3 [move 10 steps]` - students predict the sprite moves 30 steps total (3 × 10). Use concrete, visual actions like moving, stamping, or changing costume. Focus is on "multiply the action by the count" understanding. Students trace on paper or mentally before running the code.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T04.G3.03: Match a "repeat N" loop to repeated behavior


ID: T07.G3.02.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Predict the final position after a repeat loop
Description: Students predict where a sprite ends up after a `repeat N [move X steps]` loop. Given: sprite starts at x=0, code is `repeat 4 [move 25 steps]`. Students calculate: 4 × 25 = 100, so sprite ends at x=100. This skill focuses specifically on spatial/position outcomes rather than general tracing, building intuition for how loops accumulate effects.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple repeat loop





ID: T07.G3.03
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Build a forever loop for continuous animation
Description: Students create their first `forever` loop with a simple action inside (e.g., `forever [turn 15 degrees]` or `forever [next costume, wait 0.2 seconds]`) to create continuous animation. Students understand that `forever` means "keep repeating until the program stops" - there is no count. Compare with `repeat N` which stops after N times. Key insight: forever loops never end on their own.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T04.G3.04.01: Identify repeated code segments that could be simplified with templates


ID: T07.G3.03.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Compare repeat vs forever loops
Description: Students explain when to use `repeat N` vs `forever`. Given two tasks: (1) "Make the sprite spin 5 times" → use `repeat 5`, (2) "Make the sprite spin continuously" → use `forever`. Students identify that `repeat N` is for a known number of repetitions, while `forever` is for continuous/indefinite repetition. This comparison skill solidifies understanding of both loop types.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.03: Build a forever loop for continuous animation





ID: T07.G3.04
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use repeat-until to reach a goal
Description: Students use `repeat until <condition>` to move a sprite toward a goal. Example: `repeat until <touching [goal]> [move 10 steps]`. The sprite moves step by step until it reaches the target. Students understand this as "keep doing until" - combining repetition with a stopping condition. Use simple conditions like `touching [sprite]` or `touching [color]`.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple repeat loop
* T07.G3.03.01: Compare repeat vs forever loops
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script





ID: T07.G3.04.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace a repeat-until loop step by step
Description: Students trace a `repeat until` loop iteration by iteration, predicting when the stopping condition becomes true. Example: sprite at x=0, goal at x=30, code is `repeat until <touching goal> [move 10 steps]`. Trace: iteration 1 → x=10 (not touching), iteration 2 → x=20 (not touching), iteration 3 → x=30 (touching!) → STOP. Students count iterations and identify the final state. Use 3-5 iterations maximum.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.04: Use repeat-until to reach a goal





ID: T07.G3.05
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Debug a wrong repeat loop count
Description: Students identify and fix a `repeat` loop with the wrong count. Example: task is "draw 4 sides of a square" but code says `repeat 3 [move, turn 90]`. Students trace to see only 3 sides are drawn, then fix by changing to `repeat 4`. Focus on the diagnostic process: (1) read the goal, (2) trace the code, (3) notice mismatch, (4) fix the count.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple repeat loop





ID: T07.G4.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Create a forever loop for keyboard controls
Description: Students implement a `forever` loop that continuously checks keyboard input and moves the sprite. Example: `forever [if <key "right arrow" pressed?> [change x by 10]]`. Students understand why this needs to be in a forever loop: checking once wouldn't allow continuous control. This is the standard "game loop" pattern for player controls.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.03.01: Compare repeat vs forever loops
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script





ID: T07.G4.02
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Combine a loop with an if statement inside
Description: Students write a loop containing an `if` block to check a condition on each iteration. Example 1: `forever [if <touching edge?> [bounce]]` - check for edge collision every frame. Example 2: `repeat 10 [if <pick random 1 to 2 = 1> [stamp]]` - conditionally stamp on each iteration. Students understand that the if block runs on EVERY iteration, not just once.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script





ID: T07.G4.03
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use a counter variable inside a loop
Description: Students manually create and increment a counter variable inside a loop. Pattern: (1) initialize before loop: `set counter to 0`, (2) increment inside loop: `change counter by 1`. Example: display "Step 1", "Step 2", etc. using `repeat 5 [change counter by 1, say (join "Step " counter)]`. This manual counter pattern is the foundation for understanding for-loops.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T09.G3.01.01: Create a new variable with a descriptive name
* T09.G3.01.02: Set a variable to an initial value at program start





ID: T07.G4.03.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use a for-loop with automatic counter
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `for [i] from (1) to (10) at step (1)` block. The for-loop automatically: (1) creates the loop variable, (2) initializes it to START, (3) increments by STEP each iteration, (4) stops when it exceeds LIMIT. Compare with manual counter: for-loop is cleaner and less error-prone. Start with step=1 cases: `for i from 1 to 5` runs 5 times with i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Dependencies:
* T07.G4.03: Use a counter variable inside a loop





ID: T07.G4.03.02
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use for-loops with step sizes other than 1
Description: Students use for-loops with step=2, 5, 10, etc. to skip values. Examples: `for i from 0 to 20 step 2` generates even numbers (0, 2, 4, ..., 20). `for i from 5 to 50 step 5` counts by fives. Applications: create evenly-spaced stamps, generate number sequences, position objects at regular intervals. Students predict which values the loop variable takes.

* T07.G4.03.01: Use a for-loop with automatic counter





ID: T07.G4.03.03
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use for-loops to count backwards
Description: Students use negative step values to count down. Example: `for i from 10 to 1 step -1` counts 10, 9, 8, ..., 1 (countdown timer). Key insight: when step is negative, START must be greater than LIMIT. Applications: countdown displays, reverse animations, processing items from last to first. Students trace the loop to predict all values.

Dependencies:
* T07.G4.03.01: Use a for-loop with automatic counter





ID: T07.G4.04
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Refactor repeated code into a loop
Description: Students identify identical repeated blocks and convert them to a loop. Given: `move 50, turn 90, move 50, turn 90, move 50, turn 90, move 50, turn 90` (square). Refactored: `repeat 4 [move 50, turn 90]`. Process: (1) identify the repeated pattern, (2) count repetitions, (3) wrap in repeat block. Students verify the refactored code produces identical behavior.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple repeat loop





ID: T07.G4.05
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Debug off-by-one errors in loops
Description: Students identify and fix off-by-one errors where a loop runs one too many or one too few times. Example bug: `for i from 1 to 5` should run 5 times, but `for i from 0 to 5` runs 6 times. Students trace the loop to count actual iterations vs expected, then adjust start, limit, or condition. Common patterns: fence-post errors, using < vs <=, wrong initial value.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.04: Use repeat-until to reach a goal
* T07.G4.03: Use a counter variable inside a loop


ID: T07.G4.05.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Debug repeat-until condition errors
Description: Students debug `repeat until` loops with faulty stopping conditions. Example bug: `repeat until <x > 100>` never stops because x starts at 200 and increases. Students analyze: (1) what is the condition checking? (2) will it ever become true? (3) how to fix it. Common fixes: change operator direction, use different variable, add proper initialization.

Dependencies:
* T07.G4.05: Debug off-by-one errors in loops
* T07.G3.04.01: Trace a repeat-until loop step by step





ID: T07.G4.06
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace a loop containing a conditional
Description: Students trace a loop with an `if` inside, tracking which iterations trigger the condition. Example: `repeat 5 [move 20, if <touching edge?> [bounce]]`. Trace each iteration: iterations 1-3 don't touch edge, iteration 4 touches edge and bounces, iteration 5 continues in new direction. Students predict both the loop's iterations AND which conditionals fire.

Dependencies:
* T07.G4.02: Combine a loop with an if statement inside
* T07.G3.04: Use repeat-until to reach a goal





ID: T07.G4.07
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace nested loops with fixed counts
Description: Students trace nested loops (a loop inside a loop) to predict total iterations. Example: `repeat 3 [repeat 2 [stamp]]` - outer runs 3 times, inner runs 2 times EACH outer iteration, total = 3 × 2 = 6 stamps. Students create a trace table: outer iteration 1 → inner runs 2 times; outer iteration 2 → inner runs 2 times; etc. Use small counts (2-3 each) and visual outcomes.

Dependencies:
* T07.G4.03: Use a counter variable inside a loop
* T07.G4.06: Trace a loop containing a conditional





ID: T07.G4.08
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use timed repeat for spaced animations
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `repeat (N) times at intervals of (T) [seconds/milliseconds/frames]` block. This runs the loop body N times with automatic pauses between iterations. Example: `repeat 3 times at intervals of 1 second [say counter]` displays "1", waits 1 second, "2", waits 1 second, "3". Cleaner than `repeat [action, wait]` because timing is built in. Applications: countdown timers, pulsing animations, timed sequences.

Dependencies:
* T07.G4.03: Use a counter variable inside a loop
* T07.G4.01: Create a forever loop for keyboard controls





ID: T07.G5.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use a loop to run repeated experiments
Description: Students use loops to repeat a random experiment many times and count outcomes. Pattern: (1) initialize counters to 0, (2) repeat N times: generate random outcome, increment appropriate counter, (3) display results. Example: flip a coin 100 times, count heads vs tails. Students see that more trials → results closer to expected probability. This connects loops to data collection and statistics.

Dependencies:
* T07.G4.03: Use a counter variable inside a loop
* T07.G4.06: Trace a loop containing a conditional

Patterns: (1) sequential numbers: `for i from 1 to 10 [add i to list]`, (2) user input: `repeat 5 [ask "Enter name", add answer to list]`, (3) calculated values: `for i from 1 to 5 [add (i * i) to list]` creates [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]. Students delete all from list first, then use the loop to populate it.

Description: Students use loops with an accumulator variable to compute aggregates. Sum pattern: `set total to 0, for each item in scores [change total by item]`. Average pattern: add count, then `set average to (total / count)`. Example: given scores [85, 90, 78], total = 253, average = 253/3 = 84.3. Students apply this to calculate totals, averages, or other aggregate statistics from lists.

Outer loop (rows): `for row from 1 to 3`, inner loop (columns): `for col from 1 to 4 [go to x=(col*40) y=(row*40), stamp]`. Students understand: outer loop runs 3 times, inner loop runs 4 times PER outer iteration = 12 stamps total. Start with small grids (2×3 or 3×4).

Example checkerboard: `for row from 1 to 8 [for col from 1 to 8 [if ((row + col) mod 2 = 0) [set color black] else [set color white], stamp]]`. Students modify loop variables and conditions to create different patterns. This combines nested loops with conditionals for visual creativity.

ID: T07.G6.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace nested loops with variable bounds
Description: Students trace nested loops where inner loop count depends on outer loop variable. Example: `for i from 1 to 4 [repeat (i) times [stamp]]`. Trace: i=1 → 1 stamp, i=2 → 2 stamps, i=3 → 3 stamps, i=4 → 4 stamps, total = 1+2+3+4 = 10 stamps. Students calculate total iterations by summing variable inner counts. This is more complex than fixed nested loops.

Description: Students convert code with slight variations into loops using mathematical expressions. Given: `move 10, move 20, move 30, move 40`. Pattern: values are i*10 for i=1,2,3,4. Refactored: `for i from 1 to 4 [move (i * 10)]`. Students identify the mathematical relationship and express it using the loop variable. This is more advanced than G4.04's identical repetitions.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Identify and fix infinite loops
Description: Students recognize loops that never terminate and fix them. Common causes: (1) `repeat until` with impossible condition (e.g., `repeat until <x = 5>` but x never changes), (2) `forever` with no break or stop. Fixes: ensure the condition CAN become true, add a counter limit, or use `break` when appropriate. Students trace the loop to prove it never ends, then propose fixes.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use trace tables for nested loop calculations
Description: Students create trace tables to track variables through nested loops. Table columns: outer counter, inner counter, accumulator(s). Rows: one per inner iteration. Example: compute sum of products for `for i from 1 to 3 [for j from 1 to 2 [change sum by (i*j)]]`. Trace: (i=1,j=1)→sum=1, (i=1,j=2)→sum=3, (i=2,j=1)→sum=5, etc. Final sum=18. This systematic approach is essential for competition programming.

Example: `for row from 1 to 3 [for col from 1 to row [stamp at (col*30, row*30)]]` creates a triangle: row 1 → 1 stamp, row 2 → 2 stamps, row 3 → 3 stamps. Students connect loop iteration numbers to x,y coordinates.

Description: Students implement loops where each iteration updates a value based on its previous state. Examples: (1) compound interest: `repeat 5 [set balance to (balance * 1.05)]`, (2) decay: `repeat 10 [set health to (health * 0.9)]`, (3) growth: `repeat years [set population to (population + growthRate)]`. Key insight: the NEW value depends on the OLD value. This pattern is fundamental to simulations.

ID: T07.G6.08.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use break to exit a loop early
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `break` block to exit a loop immediately when a condition is met. Example: `for i from 1 to 100 [if (item i of list = target) [set found to i, break]]` - stops as soon as target is found instead of checking all 100 items. Applications: early exit from search, stop game loop on win/lose, terminate input on sentinel value. Break makes code more efficient.

Dependencies:
* T07.G6.03: Implement linear search using a loop
* T07.G4.03.01: Use a for-loop with automatic counter





ID: T07.G6.08.02
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use continue to skip loop iterations
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `continue` block to skip the current iteration and move to the next. Example: `for i from 1 to 10 [if (i mod 2 = 0) [continue], say i]` - skips even numbers, only says 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Use continue for: filtering invalid items, skipping special cases, conditional processing. Compare: continue vs wrapping loop body in if-else (continue is often cleaner).

Dependencies:
* T07.G6.08.01: Use break to exit a loop early





ID: T07.G6.09.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use for-each item to iterate over list values
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `for each item [name] in [myList]` block to process each list item by value. Example: `for each item score in highScores [say score]` - the variable `score` takes each value (85, 92, 78...) in turn. Use for-each item when you care about VALUES, not positions. Cleaner than: `for i from 1 to (length of list) [set item to (item i of list)]`.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use for-each index to iterate over list positions
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `for each index [i] in [myList]` block to iterate by position. The variable `i` takes each index (1, 2, 3...) and you access values via `item i of myList`. Use for-each index when you: need both position AND value, want to modify items in place, or work with parallel lists. Example: `for each index i in scores [replace item i of scores with (item i of scores * 2)]` - doubles each score.

Dependencies:

ID: T07.G6.10
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Iterate over parallel lists using synchronized indices
Description: Students iterate over two or more lists simultaneously using a shared index variable. Pattern: `for i from 1 to (length of names) [set name to (item i of names), set score to (item i of scores), say (join name " scored " score)]`. Applications: (1) display name-score pairs, (2) compare corresponding elements in two lists, (3) merge data from multiple sources. Key insight: parallel lists must have the same length. Students check `length of list1 = length of list2` before iterating.

Dependencies:

Applications: initialize game board, check all cells for conditions, draw tile-based maps. Students understand row-major vs column-major order and calculate 1D index from 2D coordinates if needed: `index = row * width + col`.

Description: Students compare two solutions to the same problem and count iterations. Example: compute 20 ÷ 3. Method A (repeated subtraction): 20→17→14→11→8→5→2 = 6 iterations. Method B (direct division): 1 operation. For larger numbers (2000 ÷ 3), Method A needs ~666 iterations while Method B still takes 1. Students reason about efficiency: which solution scales better?

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Optimize loop performance by reducing redundant operations
Description: Students identify and fix performance issues in loops. Common optimizations: (1) **Cache list length**: `set len to (length of list)` before loop instead of checking each iteration, (2) **Move constant calculations outside**: compute `radius * 2` once before loop, not inside, (3) **Avoid unnecessary operations**: don't update display every iteration when only final result matters. Example: inefficient loop recalculates `(length of scores)` 1000 times; optimized version calculates once. Students profile loops by counting total operations.

Description: Students compare loop alternatives and justify their choice. Considerations: (1) **Termination** - `repeat N` always terminates vs `repeat until` may not, (2) **Clarity** - for-each is clearer for list iteration than index loops, (3) **Efficiency** - break for early exit vs checking all items, (4) **Edge cases** - what if list is empty? what if condition never true? Students evaluate trade-offs for given problems.

## GRADE 3 (13 skills)




ID: T10.G3.01.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Create a new list variable
Description: Students create a new list variable in the Variables palette by clicking "Make a List" and giving it a descriptive name (e.g., "fruits", "scores", "inventory"). Lists are containers that can hold multiple values, unlike regular variables which hold only one value. Students recognize that this is the first step before any list operations can be performed, and verify the empty list appears in the Variables palette.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.01.01: Create a new variable




ID: T10.G3.01.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Add an item to the end of a list
Description: Students use the `add [item] to [list]` block to add items one at a time to the end of a list. They observe how each item is added in sequence (1, 2, 3...) and note that lists grow dynamically as items are added. Students practice adding 3-4 items and use the list monitor to verify the growing list.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.01: Create a new list variable




ID: T10.G3.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
Description: Students use the `item (1) of [list]` block to retrieve specific items from a list by their position number (index). The first item is at position 1, second at position 2, etc. Students practice reading different positions and displaying or using the retrieved values, verifying the correct item is returned.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G3.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Get the length of a list
Description: Students use the `length of [list]` block to find how many items are in a list. They observe that as items are added or removed, the length changes accordingly. This is essential for knowing the bounds when accessing list items and avoiding out-of-range errors.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G3.04.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Delete an item at a specific position
Description: Students use the `delete (position) of [list]` block to remove an item from a specific position in the list. They observe how items after the deleted position shift down (e.g., item 3 becomes item 2) and verify that the list length decreases by 1. Students practice deleting items from different positions (beginning, middle, end) and predict the resulting list state.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G3.04.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Clear all items from a list
Description: Students use the `delete all of [list]` block to remove every item from a list at once, returning it to empty. Clearing is useful for starting fresh or resetting for a new game. Students observe that after clearing, the list length becomes 0 and verify the list monitor shows an empty list.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G3.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Loop through each item in a list
Description: Students use the `for each [item] in [list]` block to automatically visit every item in sequence. Unlike counted repeat loops where you specify a number of repetitions, this block iterates through all items regardless of list length. Students perform simple actions on each item (e.g., say each fruit name) and observe that every item is processed exactly once. Keep the list short (3-4 items) and actions simple.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G3.06
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Check if a list contains a specific item
Description: Students use the `[list] contains [item]?` block to check whether a value exists in a list. They combine this with conditionals to make decisions based on list membership (e.g., "if my fruits list contains 'apple' then say 'I have an apple!'"). Students test with items that are in the list and items that are not.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script




ID: T10.G3.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Count items in a list that match a condition
Description: Students loop through a short list and count items that match a simple condition (e.g., "count numbers greater than 5" or "count items equal to 'apple'"). They use a counter variable that increments inside a conditional inside a loop. Students predict the count before running and verify their prediction matches the result.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G3.08
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Check if a list is empty before accessing
Description: Students check whether a list is empty (has zero items) before trying to read from it, to avoid errors. They use the `length of [list] = 0` condition in an if-statement to guard list access. This defensive programming pattern prevents crashes when dealing with lists that might be empty.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script




ID: T10.G3.09
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Increment or decrement a list item's value
Description: Students use the `change item (position) of [list] by (amount)` block to modify numeric values in a list arithmetically (e.g., increase a player's score by 10, decrease health by 5). This block changes the value in place without needing to manually get-calculate-replace, making score updates and counters much simpler. For young learners who don't know negative numbers, the `reduce item (position) of [list] by (amount)` block provides a simpler way to decrease values. Students verify the change by reading the item before and after modification.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G3.10
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Display a list monitor on the stage
Description: Students enable the list monitor by checking the checkbox next to the list name in the Variables palette. The monitor displays all items with their positions (1, 2, 3...) and updates in real-time as items are added, removed, or changed. Students use visual feedback to verify list state and debug their programs by watching the monitor while running code.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G3.11
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Predict and trace list changes step by step
Description: Students trace through a short sequence of list operations (3-5 blocks) and predict the final state of the list. Given blocks like: create list → add "apple" → add "banana" → delete item 1 → add "cherry", students write down what the list contains after each step and predict the final result ["banana", "cherry"]. This builds mental models of how lists work and prepares students for debugging. Students verify predictions by running the code and comparing actual vs expected results.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
* T10.G3.10: Display a list monitor on the stage

## GRADE 4 (29 skills)




ID: T10.G4.01.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find an item's position using built-in block
Description: Students use the `item # of [value] in [list]` block to find the position of a value in a list. They understand this returns the index of the first occurrence (or 0 if not found) and practice searching for items in different lists.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G4.01.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement manual linear search with loop
Description: Students implement a simple linear search algorithm by looping through a list, comparing each item to a target value, and reporting the position when found (or "not found" if the loop completes). They use a counter variable for the position and a conditional to check each item. This foundational algorithm skill teaches sequential searching and how the built-in block works internally.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G4.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Store and retrieve parallel list data
Description: Students use two lists in parallel (e.g., "playerNames" and "playerScores") where items at the same index are related. They add items to both lists together and use the same index to retrieve matching data (e.g., "the player at index 2 in names has the score at index 2 in scores"). Students recognize that keeping parallel lists synchronized is critical—adding to one requires adding to the other at the same position.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G4.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
Description: Students use the `insert [item] at (position) of [list]` block to add items at the beginning, middle, or end of a list. They observe how existing items shift to higher indices to make room and verify the new item appears at the correct position. Students practice inserting at position 1 (prepend), at length+1 (append), and at middle positions.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G4.04
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Replace an item in a list
Description: Students use the `replace item (position) of [list] with [value]` block to update an existing item without changing the list length. They practice replacing items based on position and recognize the difference between replacing (overwrites in place, same length) and inserting (shifts existing items, length increases).

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G4.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `sort list [list] from [large to small/small to large]` block to sort numeric or alphabetic lists. They observe how the order changes and note that sorting rearranges items by value. Students verify the sort by reading the first and last items to confirm the order direction.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G4.06.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find the smallest value in a list

* T10.G4.06.03: Calculate the sum of all values in a list




ID: T10.G4.06.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find the median value in a list
Description: Students use the `[median v] of list [list]` block to find the middle value when sorted. Median differs from average because it is less affected by outliers. Students identify scenarios where median is more useful than average (income data, test scores with extreme values) by comparing both measures on lists with outliers.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
* T10.G4.06.04: Calculate the average of values in a list




ID: T10.G4.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find the maximum or minimum item in a list manually
Description: Students write a loop to find the largest or smallest item in a numeric list without using built-in blocks. They initialize a "best so far" variable with the first item, loop through remaining items comparing each to the current best, and update the best when a better value is found. Students trace through a 5-item list and track how the "best so far" variable changes. This manual algorithm builds algorithmic thinking for aggregation operations.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G4.08
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Filter items from a list based on a condition
Description: Students loop through a list and build a new filtered list containing only items that satisfy a condition (e.g., "keep only scores > 50"). They create an empty result list, use conditionals inside a loop to check each item, and add matching items to the result list. Students verify the filtered list contains exactly the items that match the condition.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G4.09
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Build a high score list with parallel lists
Description: Students create a leaderboard using two parallel lists (names and scores). When a new score is added, they find the correct position to insert it (to keep scores sorted in descending order) and insert both the name and score at matching positions. Students verify that the leaderboard remains sorted after each insertion.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.01.02: Implement manual linear search with loop
* T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
* T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list




ID: T10.G4.10
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Swap two items in a list
Description: Students swap the positions of two items in a list using a temporary variable. They store one item in the temp variable, replace it with the other item, then put the temp value in the second position. Students trace through the three-step swap process and verify both items exchange positions correctly. This pattern is a building block for sorting algorithms.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list
* T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable




ID: T10.G4.11.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Copy one list to another (replacing contents)
Description: Students use the `copy [list1] to [list2]` block to duplicate a list. This REPLACES all items in list2 with items from list1, so list2's original contents are lost. After copying, both lists have identical items but remain separate (changing one doesn't affect the other). Students verify independence by modifying one list and confirming the other remains unchanged.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list




ID: T10.G4.11.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Append one list to another (adding to end)
Description: Students use the `append [list1] to [list2]` block to add all items from list1 to the END of list2. This PRESERVES list2's original items and adds list1's items below them. Students compare append vs. copy and identify when each is appropriate: copy for backup/duplication, append for combining datasets.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.11.01: Copy one list to another (replacing contents)




ID: T10.G4.12
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Split a text string into a list
Description: Students use the `set [list] to split of [text] with splitter [delimiter]` block to convert text into a list of items (e.g., split "apple,banana,orange" by "," to get a list of three fruits). Students experiment with different delimiters (comma, space, newline) and verify the resulting list contains the expected items. This introduces text processing and list creation from external data.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions




ID: T10.G4.13
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Join list items into a text string
Description: Students use the `join [list] into text with [delimiter]` block to combine list items into a single text string (e.g., join ["red", "green", "blue"] with ", " to get "red, green, blue"). This is the inverse of split and is useful for displaying list contents or saving list data as text.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.12: Split a text string into a list
* T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions




ID: T10.G4.14
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Reverse the order of items in a list

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)




ID: T10.G4.15
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Randomly shuffle items in a list
Description: Students use the `reshuffle [list] randomly` block to randomly rearrange all items. Each shuffle produces a different random order. Applications include shuffling cards, randomizing quiz questions, or creating random starting positions. Students note that reshuffling destroys the original order (make a copy first if needed).

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list




ID: T10.G4.16.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Generate a list of random numbers with options
Description: Students use the `set [list] to (N) random whole numbers between (min) and (max) [no repetition/allow repetition]` block to populate a list with random values.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
* T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list




ID: T10.G4.16.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Generate seeded random list
Description: Students use the seeded random block `set [list] to (N) random numbers with seed (SEED)` which generates the same sequence when using the same seed. This enables reproducible randomness for games (same level layout with same seed) and testing scenarios requiring consistent random data. Students verify that the same seed always produces the same list.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.16.01: Generate a list of random numbers with options




ID: T10.G4.17
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Delete an item from a list by value
Description: Students use the `delete value [item] from [list]` block to remove the first occurrence of a specific value (e.g., delete "apple" from the fruits list). This finds and removes the item without needing to know its position, which differs from deleting by index. Students test with items that exist (removes first match) and items that don't exist (no change).

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
* T10.G3.06: Check if a list contains a specific item




ID: T10.G4.18
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Loop through list indices
Description: Students use the `for each index [i] in [list]` block to iterate through list positions (1, 2, 3...) instead of values. This is necessary when they need to know both the position and the value, or when they need to modify items while looping. Students compare index-based iteration to value-based iteration and identify use cases for each.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
* T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list




ID: T10.G4.19
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Find an item containing a substring
Description: Students use the `# of item containing [substring] in [list]` block to find the first list item that includes a partial match (e.g., find first name containing "son" in a names list). Students compare exact matching (T10.G4.01.01) to partial matching and identify when each is appropriate.

* T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions




ID: T10.G4.20
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Select multiple items from a list by criteria
Description: Students use the `insert (N) [largest/smallest/random] items from [list1] into [list2]` block to extract top/bottom/random items efficiently. Applications include leaderboards (top 10 scores), random sampling (pick 5 random quiz questions), or filtering extremes (3 coldest days). Students verify results by checking that list2 contains exactly N items matching the specified criteria.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
* T10.G4.06.01: Find the smallest value in a list
* T10.G4.11.02: Append one list to another (adding to end)




ID: T10.G4.21
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Extract a sublist from a range of positions
Description: Students create a new list containing items from a specific range within an existing list. Using a loop from start position to end position, they read each item from the source list and add it to a new result list. For example, to extract items 3-5 from a 10-item list, they loop from 3 to 5, reading and adding each item. This pattern is useful for pagination (show items 11-20), processing chunks of data, or splitting a list into smaller pieces.

## GRADE 5 (22 skills)




ID: T10.G5.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Identify table structure (rows, columns, cells)
Description: Students identify and label the parts of a table: rows (horizontal, numbered), columns (vertical, named), and cells (values at row-column intersections). Given a sample table, they state the number of rows and columns, identify the value at a specific row-column intersection, and explain that each row represents one record while each column represents one attribute. Students recognize that a table is like having multiple parallel lists (one list per column) organized together, where all lists have the same length and items at the same position are related. A table makes it easier to manage related data than using many separate parallel lists.

* T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table




ID: T10.G5.11.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Remove all columns from a table
Description: Students use the `delete all columns from table [table]` block to completely reset a table to empty structure (no columns, no rows). They understand this is more destructive than deleting all rows (which keeps columns) and use this when completely restructuring a table.

Dependencies:
* T10.G5.11.02: Delete a single column




ID: T10.G5.12
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Copy list data to table column

ID: T10.G6.09
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Create and populate a nested list (2D array)
Description: Students create a list where each item is itself a list, forming a 2D grid structure. For example, a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board can be represented as a list of 3 rows, where each row is a list of 3 cells. Students create the structure by making an outer list, then adding inner lists as items. They populate cells by first accessing the inner list, then setting items within it. This introduces the concept of nested data structures as an alternative to tables for grid-based data.

Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Build a simulation using table-based state
Description: Students create a simulation (e.g., a game with multiple entities, a population model, an ecosystem) where entities and their properties are stored in a table. Each simulation step loops through rows to update values based on rules.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.03: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario
* T10.G5.07: Loop through table rows to compute aggregates




ID: T10.G8.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Query and report statistics from a complex dataset
Description: Students work with a realistic multi-column table (e.g., weather data, sports statistics, survey results) and write code to answer analytical questions: compute means, find percentiles, compare groups, identify trends, and format results as a report.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.07: Analyze a dataset to find patterns or outliers
* T10.G6.01: Sort a table by a column




ID: T10.G8.06
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Model relationships using multiple linked tables
Description: Students design and use multiple tables that reference each other (e.g., a Students table and a Grades table linked by student ID). They write code to perform lookups across tables to answer queries like "What are all grades for student X?"

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.01: Use nested loops to compare data across two tables
* T10.G7.03: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario




ID: T10.G8.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement a hash table lookup using lists
Description: Students simulate a simple hash table by using a list where each position corresponds to a hash value computed using modulo operation (e.g., hash(key) = key mod list_length for numbers, or sum of character codes mod list_length for strings). They handle collisions using linear probing (check next positions) or chaining (store multiple items at one position using lists within lists). Implementation pattern: Use a list as the hash table, create a hash function using math operators and string blocks, use linear search as fallback for collisions, and compare performance to linear search to demonstrate the principle of constant-time lookup.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.03: Implement selection sort algorithm step by step
* T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches




ID: T10.G8.08.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement binary search on sorted lists
Description: Students implement binary search algorithm to find items in O(log n) time instead of O(n) linear search. They repeatedly divide the sorted list's search space in half: compare the middle element to the target, then search either the left half (if target is smaller) or right half (if target is larger). Students trace through the algorithm step-by-step, counting comparisons, and compare performance to linear search to demonstrate logarithmic efficiency gains. This introduces divide-and-conquer algorithmic thinking.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.02: Implement bubble sort algorithm step by step
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches




ID: T10.G8.08.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use two-pointer technique for list problems
Description: Students apply two-pointer techniques where pointers move from both ends toward the center to solve problems efficiently. Common patterns: Finding pairs that sum to a target value (one pointer at start, one at end, move based on comparison), removing duplicates from sorted lists (slow and fast pointers), or checking palindromes (compare from both ends). Students implement at least one two-pointer algorithm, trace pointer movements, and understand how this technique avoids nested loops for certain problems.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.08.01: Implement binary search on sorted lists
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches




ID: T10.G8.08.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Apply sliding window algorithms
Description: Students use sliding window algorithms to efficiently process contiguous subarrays by maintaining a window that slides through the data. Common applications: finding maximum sum of k consecutive elements, longest substring without repeating characters, or moving averages. Implementation pattern: Initialize window with first k elements, slide window right by adding next element and removing leftmost element, track window state (sum, max, set of unique items), update result after each slide. Students understand how sliding window reduces O(n*k) to O(n) by reusing previous computations.

ID: T11.GK.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Circle picture cards that belong together
Description: Students identify activities that naturally belong together as a group by circling related picture cards with colored markers. For example, in a picture sequence showing "get ready for school," they circle all the steps about eating breakfast (get bowl, pour cereal, add milk, eat) in blue and all the steps about getting dressed in green. This builds the foundational idea that actions can be organized into meaningful clusters.

Assessment example: Given 12 picture cards showing a morning routine, students use colored circles to group related activities: breakfast steps in blue, getting dressed steps in green, brushing teeth steps in yellow. They explain why each group belongs together.

Dependencies:
* T01.GK.03: Find the first and last pictures
* T03.GK.01: Tap picture cards to identify parts of a whole object

ID: T11.GK.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Select a clear name for a picture card group
Description: Students select a clear, descriptive name for a group of related picture cards from multiple choice options. After grouping activities together (like in T11.GK.01), they choose a name that describes what the whole group does. For example, a group of steps about mixing ingredients should be called "Make the Batter" rather than vague names like "Step 1" or "The First Part."

Assessment example: Given three groups of picture cards (1: wash hands, put on apron, get ingredients; 2: mix, stir, pour; 3: put in oven, set timer, wait), students select appropriate names from options: "Get Ready," "Make the Batter," and "Bake the Cake" (rejecting vague options like "First Things" or "More Stuff").

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.01: Circle picture cards that belong together

---




ID: T11.GK.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Drag a named group card into a bigger picture plan
Description: Students drag named group cards into slots in a larger picture plan to simplify instructions. For example, instead of listing all breakfast steps again, a morning routine uses a single "Do Breakfast" card. Students drag named cards like "Do Breakfast," "Get Dressed," and "Pack Backpack" into the correct slots. This introduces abstraction: once you name a group, you refer to it by that single name.

Assessment example: Given three named group cards ("Do Breakfast," "Get Dressed," "Pack Backpack") and a "Get Ready for School" plan with three empty slots, students drag each card into the correct slot to create a simplified 3-step plan.

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.02: Select a clear name for a picture card group

---




ID: T11.G1.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify the main instruction set from picture cards
Description: Students examine 2–3 short sets of picture‑based instructions (e.g., "how to set up the game," "how to decorate," "how to clean up") and tap on the set that tells everyone what to do overall for an activity. This builds the idea that some instructions are the main plan and others are helper tasks.

Assessment example: Given three picture card sets for a birthday party, students tap on the "Run the Party" set (not "Set Up Decorations" or "Clean Up") as the main instructions that reference the other sets.

Dependencies:
* T01.GK.03: Find the first and last pictures





ID: T11.G1.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Match picture step groups to clear titles
Description: Students match each group of picture steps to a clear title that tells what it is for (e.g., "Getting Ready," "Playing the Game," "Clean‑Up Time"). They draw lines from picture groups to title labels, rejecting vague titles like "Stuff" or "Things to Do."

Assessment example: Given three picture groups and six title options (three good, three vague), students draw lines connecting each group to its clear title, explaining why "Set Up the Game" is better than "Some Stuff."

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.01: Identify the main instruction set from picture cards





ID: T11.G1.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Match picture groups to their purpose descriptions
Description: Students see 2–3 groups of picture instructions for a class routine and match each group to a simple purpose description by drawing lines. For example: "These steps get the classroom ready," "These steps are for playing," "These steps are for cleaning up." This strengthens the habit of explaining the role of each part of a plan.

Assessment example: Given three picture groups for a class art project and three description cards, students draw lines matching each group to its purpose: "Get supplies" → "These steps gather what we need."

Dependencies:
* T03.GK.01: Tap picture cards to identify parts of a whole object





ID: T11.G1.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Drag picture cards to split into two category boxes
Description: Students drag picture cards from a long mixed list into two labeled category boxes (e.g., "Before the event" and "During the event," or "Adult jobs" and "Student jobs"). This mirrors splitting one big routine into smaller, organized parts.

Assessment example: Given 8 picture cards for a school field trip and two boxes labeled "Before We Leave" and "At the Museum," students drag each card into the correct box.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.01: Identify the main instruction set from picture cards





ID: T11.G1.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Circle repeated activity groups in a picture sequence
Description: Students examine a longer picture-based activity plan and circle each occurrence of the same group of actions that appears multiple times. For example, in a "classroom game" sequence, they circle all instances of "reset the game board" (put pieces back, shuffle cards, reset timer) that happen before each round. This builds recognition of repetition at the group level, not just single actions.

Assessment example: Given a picture sequence for playing three rounds of a board game, students use colored circles to mark each occurrence of the "setup" activities that appear before each round, counting how many times the same group repeats.

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.03: Drag a named group card into a bigger picture plan
* T04.G1.01: Notice when steps repeat in a sequence

---




ID: T11.G1.06
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Create a label card for repeated activity groups
Description: Students create a label card for a group of activities that repeats, writing a clear name so they can refer to it instead of repeating the same steps multiple times. This introduces the practical benefit of naming: it saves time and reduces clutter.

Assessment example: After identifying that "clean workspace" (wipe table, throw away trash, put supplies away) happens multiple times in an art project, students write "Clean Workspace" on a label card and explain where to place it in the sequence.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.05: Circle repeated activity groups in a picture sequence
* T11.GK.02: Select a clear name for a picture card group

---




ID: T11.G1.07
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Replace repeated picture groups with label cards
Description: Students simplify a complex picture-based plan by replacing repeated activity groups with their label cards. Where they previously had the full sequence of steps repeated, they now drag in a single label card. This demonstrates how abstraction reduces complexity and makes plans easier to read.

Assessment example: Students take a 20-step picture sequence for a class activity that has three repeated "clean up" sections and replace each occurrence with a single "Clean Up" label card, reducing the visible sequence to 14 steps plus a labeled definition box for "Clean Up."

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.06: Create a label card for repeated activity groups

---




ID: T11.G1.08
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Decide between one label or multiple similar labels
Description: Students identify when activity groups are similar but not identical, deciding whether to create one shared label or multiple specific labels. For example, "Set Up for Game 1" and "Set Up for Game 2" involve similar activities but with different materials. This introduces the idea that sometimes you need multiple related groups rather than one group with variations.

Assessment example: Given a sequence for running two different classroom games, students compare the "setup" phases and decide whether to create "Setup Game 1" and "Setup Game 2" labels or find enough commonality for a single "Setup Game" label, explaining their reasoning.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.07: Replace repeated picture groups with label cards

---




ID: T11.G2.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Write a note card explaining a section's purpose
Description: Students write a short note card and attach it near a group of picture steps to explain why that section is there (e.g., "These steps are to get ready," "These steps are to clean up"). This is an unplugged analogue of code comments.

Assessment example: Given a picture plan with three sections, students write three note cards explaining each section's purpose and place them next to the appropriate groups.

Dependencies:
* T01.G1.01: Put pictures in order to plant a seed





ID: T11.G2.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Replace vague labels with clear descriptive titles
Description: Students identify vague or unclear section titles in a plan (e.g., "Stuff," "More things") and replace them with clearer titles that match the steps underneath (e.g., "Set up chairs," "Decorate the room"). They cross out bad labels and write better ones.

Assessment example: Given a plan with labels "Thing 1," "Other Stuff," and "Last Part," students examine each section's picture cards and rewrite the labels as "Gather Supplies," "Build the Project," and "Clean Up."

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.02: Match picture step groups to clear titles





ID: T11.G2.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Edit section titles to follow a consistent style
Description: Students review several section titles for one plan (e.g., "Set up," "Playing the game," "Clean up time!") and edit them to follow a similar style (for example, all starting with action words like "Set Up," "Play Game," "Clean Up"). This builds awareness of consistent naming.

Assessment example: Given titles "Getting ready," "PLAY!!!", and "clean-up time," students rewrite all three in a consistent style: "Get Ready," "Play the Game," "Clean Up."

Dependencies:
* T01.G1.01: Put pictures in order to plant a seed





ID: T11.G2.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Sort picture cards under category headings
Description: Students see 2–3 headings (e.g., "Before class," "During class," "After class") and a mixed set of picture step cards, then drag each card under the heading where it belongs. This extends the Grade 1 idea of splitting lists into clearly labeled sections.

Assessment example: Given headings "Morning," "Lunch," "Afternoon" and 9 mixed picture cards, students drag each card under the correct heading, creating three organized groups.

Dependencies:
* T03.G1.02: Drag part cards into function-based groups
* T03.G1.03: List steps for a simple classroom routine





ID: T11.G2.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Label activity groups for clarity, not just repetition
Description: Students decide whether to create labeled groups based on organization benefits, not just repetition. Some groups should be named and separated even if they only happen once, because they represent distinct phases. For example, "Check Safety Rules" might happen only once but deserves its own label for clarity.

Assessment example: Given a field trip plan, students mark which activity groups should get labels: some because they repeat (like "count students"), others because they're important distinct phases (like "review safety rules" or "board the bus") even though they happen only once.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.08: Decide between one label or multiple similar labels
* T03.G2.01: Choose subtasks for a simple project idea

---




ID: T11.G2.06
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Organize a plan into 3-5 labeled groups
Description: Students organize a moderately complex activity plan into 3-5 labeled groups that work together to accomplish the overall goal. They identify natural boundaries between groups and give each a clear name. This builds decomposition skills: breaking a large plan into coordinated, named pieces.

Assessment example: For a "make and serve snacks" activity, students create labels for: "Wash Hands," "Prepare Snacks," "Set Table," "Serve Snacks," "Clean Up," drawing boundaries between groups and explaining how each contributes to the whole activity.

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.05: Label activity groups for clarity, not just repetition
* T03.G2.02: Drag subtask cards into type-based category boxes

---




ID: T11.G2.07
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Draw arrows showing which groups must happen first
Description: Students draw arrows between labeled groups to show when one must happen before another, and identify groups that can happen in any order. They use simple language like "you must do Wash Hands before Prepare Snacks" or "Set Table can happen before or after Prepare Snacks."

Assessment example: Given 5 labeled activity groups for a class party, students draw arrows showing dependencies (e.g., "Set Up" → "Play Games" → "Clean Up") and circle groups that can happen in any order, explaining their reasoning.

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.06: Organize a plan into 3-5 labeled groups
* T01.G2.01: Identify pictures that must stay in order vs those that can swap

---




ID: T11.G2.08
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Sort labels into reusable vs. plan-specific categories
Description: Students identify labeled activity groups that could be useful in multiple different plans, not just the current one. For example, "Wash Hands" and "Clean Workspace" are useful in many activities (art, science, cooking). They sort labels into "reusable" and "plan-specific" categories.

Assessment example: After creating labeled groups for a cooking activity, students sort labels into two boxes: "Only for cooking" (like "Mix Ingredients") and "Useful for other activities" (like "Wash Hands" or "Clean Up"), then name two other activities where reusable labels could be used.

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.06: Organize a plan into 3-5 labeled groups

---




ID: T11.G2.09
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Write one-sentence purpose descriptions for each group
Description: Students write one sentence describing what each labeled activity group is meant to accomplish and why it's part of the overall plan. This focuses on the WHAT and WHY (the group's purpose) rather than HOW (the specific steps inside). This prepares students to design and document custom blocks with clear purposes.

Assessment example: For a classroom activity broken into labeled groups, students complete sentences like "The Setup Group gets everything ready so we can start the activity" and "The Practice Group helps us learn the new skill before we try it ourselves."

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.06: Organize a plan into 3-5 labeled groups
* T02.G2.01: Turn a picture routine into labeled boxes

ID: T11.G3.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Insert a comment block to explain code purpose
Description: Students insert the comment block (// [text]) from the My Blocks category to add simple comments that label or explain parts of their script (e.g., "// Move the cat" or "// Check if score > 10"). This introduces documenting code for others to understand.

Assessment example: Given a 5-block script, students add a comment block above each section explaining its purpose, then another student reads only the comments to describe what the script does.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple loop
* T11.G2.01: Write a note card explaining a section's purpose





ID: T11.G3.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Write a header comment summarizing script purpose
Description: Students add a comment block (// [text]) at the beginning of a script, right after the hat block, that summarizes the script's purpose and role in the larger program (e.g., "// Game initialization: sets lives to 3, resets score, shows start screen"). This is a first step toward systematic documentation.

Assessment example: Given three scripts without header comments, students write appropriate header comments that summarize what each script does in one sentence.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
* T11.G3.01: Insert a comment block to explain code purpose





ID: T11.G3.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Rename vague variables to descriptive names
Description: Students examine a script with unclear variable names (e.g., "x", "temp", "v1") and rename them to be more descriptive and meaningful (e.g., "playerScore", "enemySpeed", "livesRemaining"). They identify vague names and replace them with names that clearly indicate what the variable represents.

Assessment example: Given a script with variables named "a", "x", and "n", students rename them to "score", "playerX", and "livesLeft" based on how they're used in the code.

Dependencies:
* T09.G3.01: Create a variable and set its starting value
* T07.G3.03: Build a forever loop for simple animation
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T11.G3.01: Insert a comment block to explain code purpose





ID: T11.G3.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Merge consecutive similar blocks into one efficient block
Description: Students identify patterns of similar consecutive blocks (e.g., multiple "move 10 steps" blocks or repeated "change score by 1" blocks) and combine them into single, more efficient blocks with appropriate values (e.g., "move 30 steps" or "change score by 3"). This reduces redundancy and makes code cleaner.

Assessment example: Given a script with "move 10 steps" repeated 5 times, students delete 4 blocks and change the remaining one to "move 50 steps", verifying the behavior is the same.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.03: Build a forever loop for simple animation
* T11.G3.01: Insert a comment block to explain code purpose





ID: T11.G3.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Describe how multiple scripts work together in a project
Description: Students write or select explanations for how the scripts in a project interact and fit together (e.g., "The green-flag script sets up the game, and the key-press scripts let the player control the character"). This develops understanding of overall code organization.

Assessment example: Given a project with 4 scripts, students write one sentence describing each script's role and draw arrows showing how they relate (e.g., "Setup script initializes variables that Game script uses").

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T06.G3.02: Add a second event to the same sprite
* T08.G3.03: Pick the right conditional block for a scenario
* T11.G3.02: Write a header comment summarizing script purpose





ID: T11.G3.06
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Define a custom block without parameters
Description: Students create simple custom blocks **without parameters** using CreatiCode's define syntax. In the My Blocks category, they create a custom block with a descriptive, action-based name (e.g., define (draw square)) that groups 3-5 related blocks. The focus is on understanding how to define a reusable block using the define (BLOCKSIGNATURE) syntax.

Assessment example: Students create a custom block named "DrawSquare" that contains 4 blocks (repeat 4: move 50 steps, turn 90 degrees) and verify it works when called.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T11.G3.03: Rename vague variables to descriptive names





ID: T11.G3.07
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Call a custom block using the call syntax
Description: Students call a custom block they created using the call syntax (e.g., call draw square). They replace repeated code in their main script with calls to the custom block, experiencing how custom blocks make code more organized and easier to read.

Assessment example: Students take a script with repeated code and replace 3 identical sections with "call DrawSquare", verifying the program still works correctly.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.06: Define a custom block without parameters
* T11.G3.04: Merge consecutive similar blocks into one efficient block





ID: T11.G3.08
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Document a custom block with a purpose comment
Description: Students add a comment block (// [text]) at the beginning of a custom block's definition to describe what the block does and when to use it (e.g., "// Draws a square with side length 50"). This extends documentation skills to custom blocks.

Assessment example: Students add documentation comments to 3 custom blocks, each comment explaining in one sentence what the block does.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.06: Define a custom block without parameters
* T11.G3.02: Write a header comment summarizing script purpose





ID: T11.G3.09
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Distinguish custom blocks from built-in blocks
Description: Students learn that CreatiCode has two types of blocks: built-in blocks (provided by CreatiCode, like "move 10 steps" or "say Hello") and custom blocks (created by programmers, found in the "My Blocks" category). They examine several example projects and identify which blocks are custom (defined by the programmer) versus built-in (provided by the system). They understand that custom blocks are tools programmers create to organize their own code.

Assessment example: Given a script with 8-10 blocks including some from "Motion," "Looks," and "My Blocks" categories, students identify which blocks are custom (from My Blocks) and which are built-in, explaining how they can tell.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T02.G3.01: Match a short block script to the right task

ID: T11.G3.10
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Distinguish When to Use Custom Blocks vs Loops
Description: Students identify scenarios where a custom block (called "My Block" in CreatiCode) is more appropriate than a loop. They recognize that loops repeat the SAME action multiple times, while custom blocks group a SEQUENCE of different actions for reuse or organization. Given example scripts or problems, they choose the better organizational approach and explain their reasoning. This conceptual gateway skill builds organizational thinking without requiring students to define custom blocks yet.

Assessment example: Present 3-4 scenarios (e.g., "draw a house," "move 10 steps 5 times," "reset game state," "count to 10"). Students label each as better solved with a loop or a custom block and explain why.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple loop
* T01.G3.12: Predict the final state of a simple algorithm

ID: T11.G3.11
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Use a pre-made custom block with parameters
Description: Students use an existing custom block (e.g., `call DrawRectangle [50] [30]` or `call MoveSprite [100] [200]`) provided in a starter project, and experiment with different argument values to see how the block's behavior changes. They learn that arguments (values in square brackets when calling) let one block handle many situations. Students do not create the block themselves yet; they explore how calling a pre-made block with different values produces different results.

Assessment example: Given a starter project with `call DrawShape [sides] [size]`, students try different values like `call DrawShape [3] [50]` for a triangle and `call DrawShape [6] [30]` for a hexagon, observing how the same block creates different shapes.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.09: Distinguish custom blocks from built-in blocks
* T08.G3.02: Decide when a single if is enough
* T09.G3.01.04: Display variable value on stage using the variable monitor

ID: T11.G3.12
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify repeated or grouped actions that could become custom blocks
Description: Students examine a longer script (15-30 blocks) that is ALREADY WRITTEN and identify groups of blocks that appear multiple times OR represent distinct behaviors. They draw boxes around these groups and label each with a descriptive name (e.g., "ResetPlayer," "CheckWinCondition"). This builds the habit of recognizing natural custom block boundaries IN EXISTING CODE before actually creating them. This is ANALYSIS of existing code, as opposed to DESIGN before coding (covered in G5.01.01).

Assessment example: Given a 20-block script for a maze game, students circle and label groups like "move character," "check wall collision," and "update score display," explaining why each group makes sense as a potential custom block.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.11: Use a pre-made custom block with parameters
* T09.G3.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
* T08.G3.03: Pick the right conditional block for a scenario

ID: T11.G3.13
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify reporter blocks in existing code
Description: Students learn to recognize reporter blocks (blocks with rounded shapes that fit inside input slots) versus command blocks (blocks that perform actions and stack vertically). Using existing CreatiCode projects, they identify reporter blocks like `(pick random 1 to 10)`, `(distance to [sprite])`, or `(x position)` and observe where these blocks can be used (inside input slots of other blocks). This prepares students to understand return values from custom reporter blocks in later grades.

Assessment example: Given 10-12 different blocks from various categories, students sort them into "reporter blocks" (rounded, return a value) and "command blocks" (rectangular, do an action) and show one example of where each type can be used in a script.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.12: Identify repeated or grouped actions that could become custom blocks
* T09.G3.04: Debug a single missing or wrong variable block
* T07.G3.04: Use repeat-until to reach a simple goal

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Navigate the "Make a Block" interface and create empty blocks
Description: Students open CreatiCode's "My Blocks" category, click "Make a Block," and navigate the basic interface. They type a simple block name (without parameters, like "ResetGame" or "JumpUp") and observe the preview of how the block will look. After clicking OK, they see the `define (ResetGame)` hat block appear, understanding this is where they add the block's code. They practice this process 2-3 times with different names.

Assessment example: Students open the "Make a Block" dialog, type three different simple block names ("StartGame", "ShowMenu", "PlaySound"), observe each preview, click OK to see the define block appear, and explain what the define block is for.

Skill: Add one parameter to a custom block interface
Description: Students extend their exploration of the "Make a Block" interface by adding a single parameter using parentheses notation. They type block names with one input like `DrawSquare (size)` or `SayMessage (text)` and observe how the parameter appears in both the preview and the resulting `define (DrawSquare (size))` hat block. They understand that text in parentheses becomes an input slot that will receive values when the block is called.

Assessment example: Students create 2-3 custom block interfaces with one parameter each (like `Jump (height)`, `MoveForward (distance)`, `SetSpeed (speed)`), observing the preview and define block for each, then cancel or delete without implementing the blocks.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Define and call a simple custom block (no parameters)
Description: Students create their first complete custom block with no inputs (e.g., `ResetPlayer`) using CreatiCode's "Make a Block" button. In the dialog, they type just the block name. After clicking OK, a `define (ResetPlayer)` hat block appears where they add 3-5 blocks inside the definition. To run the custom block, they use `call ResetPlayer` from a main script. Students compare the before/after organization to see how custom blocks improve readability by grouping related actions under a meaningful name.

Assessment example: Students create a `SetupGame` custom block that goes to x:0 y:0, sets score to 0, and shows the sprite. They then call it from the green flag script using `call SetupGame`, verifying that the grouped actions execute when called.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Call a custom block from multiple places
Description: Students practice the key benefit of custom blocks: reuse. They create one custom block definition (like `ResetPlayer` or `ClearScreen`) and call it from 2-3 different places in their program (e.g., from the green flag script at startup, from a "game over" script, from a "restart" button). They verify that changing the definition once updates the behavior everywhere it's called, demonstrating the power of abstraction.

Assessment example: Students create a `ShowWelcomeMessage` custom block that says "Welcome!" and sets the sprite to x:0 y:0. They call this block from both the green flag event and when the space key is pressed, verifying that the same behavior happens in both places.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Distinguish command blocks from reporter blocks
Description: Students learn to recognize which blocks DO something (command/stack blocks that perform actions) and which blocks RETURN a value (reporter blocks with rounded shapes). In CreatiCode, command blocks stack vertically in scripts and are called with `call BlockName`, while reporter blocks fit inside input slots. Students categorize a set of BUILT-IN blocks first, understanding the two types before learning about custom reporters with `report` syntax in Grade 5.

Assessment example: Given 10 built-in blocks (mix of commands like "move 10 steps" and reporters like "(x position)" or "(pick random 1 to 10)"), students categorize them as "command blocks" (do something) or "reporter blocks" (return a value) and for each explain where it can be used.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Use a built-in reporter block's result in a calculation or condition
Description: Students call built-in reporter blocks (like `(pick random 1 to 10)`, `(distance to [sprite])`, `(length of [list])`) and use their returned values directly in conditions or arithmetic expressions (e.g., `if <(distance to [sprite]) < 50>`, `set x to ((pick random 1 to 10) + 5)`). They practice chaining and nesting multiple reporters together in compound expressions, understanding that reporters can be nested inside other blocks' input slots. This prepares them to create their own custom reporter blocks in Grade 5.

Assessment example: Students create a script that uses `if <(distance to [Cat]) < 100>` to detect when the player is near an enemy, combining the reporter block with a comparison operator.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Nest reporter blocks inside other reporters
Description: Students practice nesting reporter blocks inside other reporter blocks to create more complex expressions. For example, they place `(pick random 1 to 10)` inside `(+ 5)` to create `((pick random 1 to 10) + 5)`, or nest `(length of [list])` inside `(* 2)` for calculations. This builds comfort with reporter composition, a key skill for using custom reporters later.

Assessment example: Students create expressions that nest 2-3 reporter blocks, such as `((x position) + ((pick random 1 to 10) * 5))` to add a random offset to the sprite's current position.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Describe the purpose of each custom block in a script
Description: Students read a script that uses several custom blocks (called with `call BlockName`) and write a one-sentence description of each block's PURPOSE (e.g., "The `call ResetPlayer` block resets the player to the starting position and clears the score"). They focus on WHAT each block does (its goal), not HOW it does it (implementation details). They also identify how blocks fit together in the program's overall structure (e.g., setup, game loop, scoring, ending).

Assessment example: Given a game script with blocks `call SetupGame`, `call MovePlayer`, `call CheckCollision`, and `call UpdateScore`, students write a sentence describing what each block does based on its name and context.

Skill: Trace execution through a script with custom blocks
Description: Students trace step-by-step through a script that uses `call` blocks, predicting the order of execution. When the script reaches `call MyBlock`, students trace INTO the custom block definition, follow the blocks inside, then return to continue after the call. They number each block in execution order and track any variable changes. This LOW-LEVEL tracing (execution order) complements G4.04's HIGH-LEVEL understanding (purpose).

Assessment example: Given a script with `when green flag clicked` → `call Setup` → `call MainLoop`, students number all blocks in order: 1-3 in the main script, then 4-7 inside Setup's definition, then 8-12 inside MainLoop's definition.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify the argument block in a custom block definition
Description: Students examine a custom block definition with one parameter and identify the `(argument (name))` reporter block used inside the definition. They understand that this special reporter block represents "the value that gets passed in" when the block is called. They locate where the argument block appears in the definition and recognize it only works inside that definition.

Assessment example: Given a `define (DrawSquare (size))` block with several blocks inside including `move (argument (size)) steps`, students identify which block is the argument block and explain that it retrieves the "size" value passed when calling the block.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.01: Define and call a simple custom block (no parameters)

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Trace the flow of a parameter value through a custom block
Description: Students trace how a value passed during a `call` flows through a custom block definition via the `(argument (name))` block. For example, with `define (SayTwice (message))` containing `say (argument (message))` and `wait 1 seconds` and `say (argument (message))`, when students trace `call SayTwice [Hello]`, they identify that each `(argument (message))` evaluates to "Hello" at runtime. This builds understanding of parameter substitution.

Assessment example: Given `define (MoveAndTurn (distance))` with blocks `move (argument (distance)) steps` and `turn right ((argument (distance)) / 2) degrees`, students trace what happens when `call MoveAndTurn [60]` runs, showing that the first argument returns 60 and the second returns 30.

Skill: Define a custom block with one parameter
Description: Students create their first custom block with one input parameter using CreatiCode's "Make a Block" button. They type the block name with one parameter in parentheses like `DrawSquare (size)`. After clicking OK, a `define (DrawSquare (size))` hat block appears. Inside the definition, they use the `(argument (size))` reporter to access the parameter value. They call the block with different arguments like `call DrawSquare [50]` and `call DrawSquare [100]` to see how the parameter makes the block reusable for different sizes.

Assessment example: Students create `define (SayHello (name))` with `say (join [Hello, ] (argument (name)))` inside. They test it by calling `call SayHello [Alice]` and `call SayHello [Bob]`, verifying different outputs.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Call the same custom block with different parameter values
Description: Students practice the key value of parameters: one block definition can handle many different situations by changing the input values. They create one parameterized custom block and call it 3-5 times with different argument values, observing how the same code produces different results based on the inputs. This reinforces understanding of parameters as "customization points" that make blocks more versatile.

Assessment example: Students create `define (DrawPolygon (sides))` and call it multiple times: `call DrawPolygon [3]` (triangle), `call DrawPolygon [4]` (square), `call DrawPolygon [6]` (hexagon), `call DrawPolygon [8]` (octagon), seeing how one block creates all these shapes.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Test a custom block with simple inputs
Description: Students test a newly created parameterized custom block by calling it with 2-3 different input values to verify it works as expected. They observe the sprite's behavior or output for each test case and confirm the block performs its intended action correctly. This introduces basic testing practices early, building habits of verification: try different values, check the result, identify if something doesn't work right.

Assessment example: After creating `define (MoveDistance (steps))`, students test it with `call MoveDistance [10]`, `call MoveDistance [50]`, and `call MoveDistance [100]`, observing that the sprite moves the correct distance each time.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Recognize when to use a parameter vs a fixed value
Description: Students analyze custom block scenarios and decide whether a value should be a parameter (input) or a fixed value (hardcoded in the block definition). They understand that values that need to change between different calls should be parameters, while values that stay the same can be fixed. For example, in a "JumpUp" block, the jump height might be a parameter, but the animation delay might be a fixed value.

Assessment example: Given 4-5 custom block scenarios like "play a sound effect" (should the sound name be a parameter?) or "reset player position" (should the starting position be a parameter?), students decide which values should be parameters and explain their reasoning.

Skill: Extract repeated code segments into a custom block
Description: Students identify identical or nearly-identical code segments that appear multiple times (within or across scripts) and extract them into a single custom block. Focus is on recognizing exact duplication and eliminating it through reuse.

Assessment example: Given a script with the same 5-block sequence appearing 3 times, students create a custom block containing those blocks and replace all 3 occurrences with calls to the new block.

Skill: Audit and rename all unclear variables in a project
Description: Students audit a project's variables and ensure that all have clear, descriptive names (e.g., "playerScore" instead of "x", "livesRemaining" instead of "n"). They rename unclear variables to follow a consistent naming convention and make the code easier to understand.

Assessment example: Given a project with variables named "a", "b", "x", "temp", students rename all of them to descriptive names and explain their choices.

Skill: Identify and document variable scope choices
Description: Students identify whether each variable in a project is "for this sprite only" (local) or "for all sprites" (global) and add comments explaining why each variable has its particular scope. They practice choosing appropriate scope when creating new variables and document their reasoning (e.g., "// playerScore is for all sprites so the score display can read it" or "// tempCalculation is for this sprite only because no other sprite needs it").

ID: T11.G4.19
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Refactor a fixed custom block by adding a parameter
Description: Students take an existing custom block without parameters and add a single input parameter to make it more flexible. For example, they convert a "DrawSquare50" block (that always draws 50-pixel squares) into "DrawSquare (size)" that can draw any size. They identify which fixed values should become parameters and update the block definition and all call sites. This refactoring skill teaches adding parameters to existing blocks (complements T11.G4.10 which creates parameterized blocks from scratch).

Assessment example: Given a "Jump100" custom block that always jumps 100 pixels, students refactor it into "Jump (height)" and update all 4 call sites to pass appropriate height values.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.11: Call the same custom block with different parameter values

ID: T11.G4.20
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Pass variable values as arguments to custom blocks
Description: Students call custom blocks by passing variable values (not just literal numbers) as arguments. For example, `call DrawSquare [size]` where size is a variable, or `call MoveSprite [playerX] [playerY]`. This shows how custom blocks become even more flexible when combined with variables.

Assessment example: Students create a loop that calls `call DrawSquare [i * 10]` with i increasing each iteration, demonstrating that variables and expressions can be passed as arguments.

Description: Given a project description (e.g., "make a simple quiz game"), students identify 2-3 distinct main responsibilities or phases that would each make a good custom block (e.g., "show question," "check answer," "update score"). This preliminary decomposition skill helps students see major functional boundaries before detailed planning. Students explain what each responsibility does, preparing for more detailed decomposition in T11.G5.01.02.

Assessment example: Given "Create a platformer game," students identify 3 main responsibilities like "player movement," "collision detection," and "level progression," explaining briefly what each area involves.

Skill: Create a complete custom block decomposition plan
Description: Students take a project description and create a complete plan showing 4-6 custom blocks with clear names and brief descriptions of each block's responsibility. This is problem decomposition BEFORE coding—students plan the custom block structure first, then implement. They ensure each block has a single clear purpose and the blocks work together to accomplish the project goal. They may sketch or write out how the blocks will be called and interact.

Assessment example: Given "Create a pet care game," students plan custom blocks like `FeedPet (foodType)`, `PlayWithPet (activity)`, `CheckHealth`, `UpdateMood`, `ShowStatus`, explaining what each block does and which blocks call others.

Skill: Create 2-3 parameterized custom blocks for a small project
Description: Students implement a small project (10-15 blocks total) that uses 2-3 custom blocks with parameters. Each block should have 1-2 parameters and be called from at least one place. They practice creating the definitions using the `define` block, implementing the logic inside using `argument` blocks, and calling the blocks using the `call` syntax with appropriate arguments. This introduces coordinated use of multiple custom blocks.

Assessment example: Students create a simple drawing tool with two custom blocks: `define (DrawLine (length))` and `define (ChangeColor (colorName))`. They use these blocks together to draw a pattern with different colored lines of various lengths.

Skill: Demonstrate code reuse with parameterized custom blocks
Description: Students extend their project from T11.G5.02.01 to demonstrate how parameterized custom blocks enable code reuse. They call the same custom block with different parameter values in multiple places, showing that one flexible block definition can handle many similar situations. They explain how this reduces code duplication and makes the program easier to understand and modify.

Assessment example: Students create `define (DrawPolygon (sides) (size))` and use it throughout a drawing program: `call DrawPolygon [3] [50]` for triangles, `call DrawPolygon [4] [60]` for squares, `call DrawPolygon [6] [40]` for hexagons, demonstrating that one block handles all regular polygons.

ID: T11.G5.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Match parameter names to argument values when calling custom blocks
Description: Students trace how argument values passed during a `call` block correspond to parameter names in the custom block definition by position. For `define (DrawRect (width) (height))` called with `call DrawRect [100] [50]`, students identify that 100 maps to `width` and 50 maps to `height`. They practice with blocks having 2-3 parameters, understanding that arguments are matched by POSITION (first argument to first parameter, etc.) not by name.

Assessment example: Given `define (MoveAndSay (x) (y) (message))` and `call MoveAndSay [100] [200] [Hello]`, students identify which value each parameter receives and predict what each `(argument (...))` block would return inside the definition.

Skill: Debug incorrect parameter order
Description: Students identify and fix bugs caused by arguments being passed in the wrong order. They examine calls to custom blocks where the arguments are swapped or misplaced, predict the incorrect behavior, then fix the call to pass arguments in the correct order. This reinforces understanding that argument position matters and builds debugging skills for a common mistake.

Assessment example: Given `define (CreatePlayer (name) (color) (size))` and a buggy call `call CreatePlayer [30] [red] [Alice]`, students identify that the arguments are in wrong positions, predict the bug (size gets "Alice", name gets 30, etc.), and write the corrected call `call CreatePlayer [Alice] [red] [30]`.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Choose between adding a parameter vs creating a separate block
Description: Students analyze scenarios and decide whether to add a parameter to an existing custom block OR create separate blocks. For example: should `DrawRectangle` have a color parameter (`DrawRectangle (width) (height) (color)`), or should there be separate `DrawRedRectangle` and `DrawBlueRectangle` blocks? They justify design choices: parameters are better when the variation is continuous/has many possible values; separate blocks may be clearer when there are few fixed options.

Assessment example: For "play different sound effects in a game," students decide between `PlaySound (soundName)` vs separate `PlayJumpSound`, `PlayCoinSound`, `PlayGameOverSound` blocks, and explain their reasoning based on how many sounds there are and whether new sounds will be added.

Skill: Analyze a modular program structure
Description: Students examine a larger project (game, animation, simulation) and identify how it uses custom blocks to organize functionality into major components. They explain how this modular design makes the code easier to understand, modify, and debug compared to a non-modular version. They create a diagram or outline showing the major custom blocks and their relationships (which blocks call which other blocks).

Assessment example: Given a complete game project with 6-8 custom blocks, students create a structure diagram showing the main script at the top, which blocks it calls directly, and which helper blocks are called by those blocks, explaining how the organization improves clarity.

Skill: Define a custom block with two or more parameters
Description: Students create a custom block with multiple parameters (e.g., `DrawRectangle (width) (height)` or `MoveSprite (x) (y) (speed)`). Inside the definition, they access each parameter using the `argument` block for each parameter name. They practice ordering parameters logically and using clear parameter names. They call the block with various argument combinations, testing that each parameter works correctly.

Assessment example: Students create `define (DrawRectangle (width) (height) (color))` with code that uses all three parameters. They test with calls like `call DrawRectangle [100] [50] [red]` and `call DrawRectangle [80] [120] [blue]`.

* T11.G4.10: Define a custom block with one parameter
* T11.G5.05: Match parameter names to argument values when calling custom blocks

Skill: Decide whether a custom block should be a command or reporter
Description: Students analyze scenarios and decide whether a custom block should perform an action (command block, use `call`) or return a value (reporter block, use `report` with `return`). For example, "DrawCircle" should be a command (it does something visual), while "CalculateArea" should be a reporter (it computes and returns a number). They justify their design choice based on whether the block DOES something or COMPUTES something. This introduces the concept of custom reporters before implementing them in T11.G5.08.

Assessment example: Given 6-8 custom block scenarios (e.g., "move sprite to position," "calculate distance between sprites," "draw polygon," "find maximum value," "reset game state," "check if player won"), students categorize each as command or reporter and explain their reasoning.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.03: Distinguish command blocks from reporter blocks
* T11.G4.10: Define a custom block with one parameter
* T11.G5.03: Create 2-3 parameterized custom blocks for a small project

ID: T11.G5.11
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Define a custom reporter block that returns a value
Description: Students create a custom block that returns a value using CreatiCode's `return [value]` block inside the definition. For example, `define (Average (a) (b))` with a `return [((argument (a)) + (argument (b))) / 2]` block. To use the return value, they call the block with `report Average [10] [20]` instead of `call`, allowing the result to be used in expressions, conditions, or variable assignments.

Assessment example: Students create a custom reporter block `define (Maximum (a) (b))` that returns the larger of two numbers using an if-else block and two return blocks. They test it in different contexts: `say (report Maximum [5] [3])`, `set score to (report Maximum [score] [0])`, and `if <(report Maximum [x] [y]) > 100>`.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.10: Decide whether a custom block should be a command or reporter
* T11.G4.04: Use a built-in reporter block's result in a calculation or condition

ID: T11.G5.12
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Use custom reporter return value in multiple contexts
Description: Students practice using the value returned by their custom reporter blocks in various contexts: inside other reporters, in conditional tests, in variable assignments, and nested inside other custom blocks. They demonstrate that custom reporters work just like built-in reporters—they can be placed anywhere a value is needed. This builds fluency with reporter composition and reinforces that well-designed reporters are versatile tools.

Assessment example: Students create `define (DistanceBetween (x1) (y1) (x2) (y2))` that returns the calculated distance. They use it in multiple ways: `say (report DistanceBetween [0] [0] [100] [100])`, `if <(report DistanceBetween [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2]) < 50>`, and `set closestDistance to (report DistanceBetween [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2])`.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Debug a script with incorrect custom block calls
Description: Students examine a script that uses custom blocks incorrectly and identify 2-3 bugs. Common errors include: wrong argument values, missing calls, arguments in wrong order, using `call` when `report` is needed (or vice versa), wrong number of arguments, or calling a block before it's defined. They fix each bug and test that the corrected script works properly.

Assessment example: Given a script with bugs like `call MoveSprite [100]` (missing second argument), `set x to (call GetPosition)` (should use `report`), and `call DrawShape [red] [5]` (arguments swapped), students identify each bug, explain the problem, and write the correct version.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Use comments to document custom block purpose
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `// [comment]` block to add comments inside and above custom block definitions, documenting what the block does, what each parameter represents, and what value it returns (if any). They practice writing clear, concise documentation comments that help others (or their future selves) understand the block's purpose and usage without reading all the implementation details.

Assessment example: Students add documentation comments to their custom blocks, such as: `// This block draws a polygon with the given number of sides and size`, `// Parameters: sides (number), size (number)`, `// Returns: nothing (command block)`.

ID: T11.G5.15
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Create custom blocks with mixed text labels and parameters
Description: Students create custom blocks that include both descriptive text labels AND input parameters to make the block read like natural language. For example, `Move sprite (sprite) to x (x) y (y)` or `Set (variable) to random from (min) to (max)`. In CreatiCode's "Make a Block" dialog, they type the full block signature with text labels between parameters, making the block's purpose clear when used in scripts. This improves code readability by making block calls self-documenting.

Assessment example: Students create a block like `Draw (shape) with size (size) and color (color)` that reads naturally when called: `call Draw [square] with size [50] and color [red]`, making the code easy to understand at a glance.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.09: Define a custom block with two or more parameters
* T11.G5.14: Use comments to document custom block purpose
* T09.G5.01: Use multiple variables together in a single expression

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Identify when code duplication signals need for custom block
Description: Students examine code with duplicated sequences of 3-5 blocks and recognize this as a signal that a custom block should be created. They identify the duplicated sections, note any values that vary between duplications (potential parameters), and explain how creating a custom block would improve the code. This "code smell" detection skill helps students proactively recognize refactoring opportunities.

Assessment example: Given a script with three identical 5-block sequences for checking different sprite collisions (only the sprite name changes), students identify the duplication, suggest a `CheckCollision (spriteName)` custom block, and explain how it would eliminate the repeated code.

Description: Students write a clear project description (in the project notes or as a comment at the top of the main script) that explains: (1) what the project does, (2) how to use it (controls/interactions), and (3) what the main features are. This user-facing documentation helps others understand the project without reading the code.

ID: T11.G5.18
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Add inline comments explaining how code works and why choices were made
Description: Students add comments that explain what specific blocks or sections of code do and why they chose that approach (e.g., "This loop moves the sprite 10 steps at a time until it reaches the edge - I use a loop instead of separate move blocks to make it easy to change the number of steps"). Focus is on describing behavior and simple reasoning for someone reading the code for the first time.

Skill: Organize a project with 3+ features into labeled sections or scripts
Description: Students structure a larger project into clearly marked sections (using comments and script organization) such as "Initialization," "Player Controls," "Collision Detection," "Score Display," etc. This introduces larger-scale code organization.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.17: Write a project description explaining what the program does

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Review another student's code and suggest at least 2 organizational improvements
Description: Students informally review a peer's project and provide constructive feedback on its organization, naming, and documentation (e.g., "The variable names are clear, but some scripts are very long and could be split up"). Focus is on learning to give helpful feedback to peers.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.17: Write a project description explaining what the program does

ID: T11.G5.21
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Nest custom reporter blocks inside other reporters
Description: Students nest custom reporter blocks by using the return value of one block as an argument to another. For example, `report DoubleValue [(report CalculateArea [5] [10])]` nests CalculateArea inside DoubleValue. They compose complex calculations from simpler building blocks, demonstrating the power of well-designed reporter interfaces.

Assessment example: Students create two reporter blocks (GetDistance and DoubleIt) and nest them: `report DoubleIt [(report GetDistance [sprite1] [sprite2])]`, verifying the composed result is twice the distance.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.21: Define a custom block with two parameters

ID: T11.G5.22
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Use reporter return values in conditions and assignments
Description: Students use custom reporter return values in various contexts: in conditional tests (`if <(report IsColliding [player] [enemy])>`), in variable assignments (`set distance to (report GetDistance [x1] [y1])`), and in expressions. This reinforces that reporters can be used anywhere a value is needed.

Assessment example: Students create a custom reporter `IsInBounds (x) (y)` that returns true/false, then use it in an if statement: `if <(report IsInBounds [newX] [newY])> then move`.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.11: Define a custom reporter block that returns a value
* T11.G5.12: Use custom reporter return value in multiple contexts





ID: T11.G5.23
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Refactor a command block into a reporter block
Description: Students refactor an existing custom command block that sets a variable into a custom reporter block that returns a value instead. For example, converting `SetCalculatedScore (points)` that sets a global variable into `CalculateScore (points)` that returns the value. They update all call sites from `call` syntax to `report` syntax and modify code that read the global variable to use the returned value directly.

Assessment example: Students refactor `call CalculateBonus [score]` (which sets a global bonus variable) into `set bonus to (report CalculateBonus [score])`, making the data flow explicit.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.21: Nest custom reporter blocks inside other reporters
* T11.G4.20: Pass variable values as arguments to custom blocks





ID: T11.G5.24
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Design custom blocks with natural language-style signatures
Description: Students create custom blocks with mixed text labels and parameters (e.g., define (move (sprite) to x (x) y (y)) or define (add (a) to (b))) to make blocks read like natural language and be more intuitive to use. They design block signatures that clearly communicate the block's purpose through natural phrasing.

Assessment example: Students redesign blocks with unclear signatures like `DoMove [50] [100]` into readable versions like `Move sprite to x [50] y [100]`, making the code self-documenting.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.15: Create custom blocks with mixed text labels and parameters
* T11.G5.20: Review another student's code and suggest at least 2 organizational improvements





ID: T11.G6.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Choose clear, descriptive names for custom blocks
Description: Students practice naming custom blocks with clear, descriptive names that communicate the block's purpose. They evaluate name quality: good names use verbs for command blocks and noun phrases for reporters, are specific rather than vague, and follow consistent naming conventions. They compare weak names (like "Block1," "DoStuff," "X") with strong names (like "ResetPlayer," "CheckCollision," "CalculateScore") and explain why the strong names are better.

Assessment example: Given 8-10 poorly named custom blocks like "Go," "Thing," "Block2," "X," students suggest better names and explain their improvements. For example, "Go" might become "MoveToStartPosition" and "Thing" might become "UpdateHealthBar."

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.07: Choose between adding a parameter vs creating a separate block
* T11.G5.08: Analyze a modular program structure
* T11.G5.09: Define a custom block with two or more parameters

ID: T11.G6.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Design clear parameter lists for custom blocks
Description: Students design parameter lists for custom blocks by determining what inputs the block needs and choosing descriptive parameter names. They consider parameter order (most important or natural reading order first) and avoid redundant parameters. They practice thinking through "what information does this block need from the caller?" and "what names make the block call easy to understand?"

Assessment example: For a block that should "move a sprite smoothly from its current position to a target position," students design the parameter list, deciding between options like `MoveTo (x) (y)` vs `MoveSprite (sprite) to (x) (y)` vs `MoveSmoothly (x) (y) (speed)`, explaining trade-offs for each design.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.01: Choose clear, descriptive names for custom blocks

ID: T11.G6.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation
Description: Students design custom blocks by fully specifying the interface (name, parameters, return value if any, and purpose description) BEFORE writing the code inside. They complete a design template for 3-5 custom blocks: block name with parameters, what it does (one sentence), what each parameter means, what it returns (if anything). This "interface-first" design approach ensures blocks have clear, well-thought-out contracts before implementation, making them more reusable and maintainable.

Assessment example: For a "battle system" feature, students design interfaces: `Attack (attacker) (defender) returns: damage dealt`, `Heal (target) (amount) returns: actual healing (after max HP cap)`, `CheckDefeat (sprite) returns: true if HP <= 0`, completing a design document before any coding.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.02: Design clear parameter lists for custom blocks

ID: T11.G6.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Create a program with 4-6 coordinated custom blocks
Description: Students design and implement a moderately complex program (e.g., a game with setup, gameplay, and end screen) structured as a set of 4-6 custom blocks, each handling a distinct responsibility. They demonstrate that the blocks work together to accomplish the program's goal, with a clear main script that coordinates the custom blocks. This is modular programming in practice.

Assessment example: Students create a quiz game with blocks: `SetupQuiz`, `ShowQuestion (questionNum)`, `CheckAnswer (userAnswer)`, `UpdateScore (correct)`, `ShowResults`, with a main script that coordinates these blocks to run a complete quiz.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.03: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation
* T11.G5.08: Analyze a modular program structure
* T11.G5.09: Define a custom block with two or more parameters

ID: T11.G6.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Verify custom block independence and isolation
Description: Students verify that their custom blocks are properly independent—changing one block's internal implementation doesn't break other blocks as long as the interface (name, parameters, return value) stays the same. They demonstrate this by modifying a block's internals (changing how it accomplishes its goal) while keeping the interface the same, and showing that the rest of the program still works correctly. This teaches the value of abstraction and encapsulation.

Assessment example: Students modify the internal implementation of their `DrawPolygon (sides)` block (changing from a repeat loop to explicit turn commands for triangles/squares) and verify that all calls to `DrawPolygon` in other parts of the program still work without any changes to those calling scripts.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.04: Create a program with 4-6 coordinated custom blocks

ID: T11.G6.06
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Test custom blocks with boundary and edge cases
Description: Students test their custom blocks systematically with not just normal inputs, but also boundary values (e.g., 0, 1, maximum values) and edge cases (negative numbers, very large numbers, empty strings). They identify and fix bugs that only appear with certain inputs. For example, testing a "DrawPolygon (sides)" block with sides=3 (normal), sides=100 (large), sides=2 (invalid), sides=0 (invalid), and sides=-5 (invalid).

Assessment example: Students create a test plan for a custom block like `ClampValue (value) (min) (max)` and test it with: value within range, value equal to min, value equal to max, value below min, value above max, min > max, and all equal values, documenting expected and actual results.

ID: T11.G6.07
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Handle invalid inputs gracefully in custom blocks
Description: Students add defensive code to custom blocks to detect and handle invalid inputs appropriately. Instead of allowing blocks to crash or produce nonsense results with bad inputs, they add checks (using if blocks) and either: display an error message, use safe default values, or return a special "error" value. This introduces the concept of robust code that anticipates misuse.

Assessment example: Students modify their `DrawPolygon (sides)` block to check: if sides < 3, say "Error: need at least 3 sides" and stop the block. They test that the block now handles invalid inputs gracefully instead of attempting to draw an impossible shape.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.06: Test custom blocks with boundary and edge cases

ID: T11.G6.08
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Refactor spaghetti code into organized custom blocks
Description: Students take a messy, unorganized script (20-30 blocks) and improve it by identifying and extracting logical units into custom blocks, dramatically improving readability without changing behavior. They verify the refactored code produces the same output. This teaches the practical skill of improving existing code through decomposition and organization.

Assessment example: Given a 25-block script that mixes game setup, player movement, collision checking, and scoring all in one long sequence, students refactor it into `SetupGame`, `MovePlayer`, `CheckCollisions`, and `UpdateScore` custom blocks, demonstrating that the refactored version is easier to understand and modify while producing identical behavior.

ID: T11.G6.09
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Add input validation to custom blocks
Description: Students add input validation to custom blocks to check that parameters meet requirements before executing the main logic. They use conditional blocks to verify parameter values are in valid ranges, are the right type, or meet other constraints. When validation fails, the block provides clear feedback. This is a more sophisticated version of error handling that validates inputs proactively.

Assessment example: In a `SetPlayerSpeed (speed)` block, students add validation: if speed < 0 or speed > 100, say "Speed must be between 0 and 100" and stop the block. Otherwise, set the speed variable. They test with valid and invalid inputs to verify the validation works.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.06: Test custom blocks with boundary and edge cases
* T11.G5.09: Define a custom block with two or more parameters

---




ID: T11.G6.10
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Critique custom block naming and parameter choices
Description: Students evaluate custom block designs focusing specifically on naming conventions and parameter choices. They identify unclear or inconsistent names (e.g., "block1" vs "CalculateScore"), overly generic parameter names (e.g., "x" vs "playerScore"), missing parameters (forcing users to set variables before calling), or redundant parameters (values that could be calculated inside the block). They suggest concrete improvements to make blocks more understandable and reusable.

Assessment example: Given 5-6 custom block signatures like `DoStuff (x) (y)`, `Calculate (num)`, `MoveSprite (sprite) left (distance) by (amount)` (redundant parameters), students critique each and suggest improved names and parameter lists, explaining why the improvements matter.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.03: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation
* T11.G5.07: Choose between adding a parameter vs creating a separate block
* T11.G5.15: Create custom blocks with mixed text labels and parameters

ID: T11.G6.11
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Evaluate custom block scope and single responsibility
Description: Students evaluate whether custom blocks follow the "single responsibility principle"—each block should do ONE thing well. They identify blocks that try to do too much (e.g., a "SetupAndStartGame" block that does setup, plays music, shows instructions, AND starts the timer—four responsibilities) or too little (e.g., a block that just sets one variable—could be done without a custom block). They explain whether blocks should be split into smaller blocks or combined into larger ones, justifying their recommendations.

Assessment example: Students review 4-5 custom blocks and identify which ones violate single responsibility. For example, they identify that `SetupGameAndShowInstructions` should be split into two blocks: `SetupGame` (initializes variables and positions) and `ShowInstructions` (displays tutorial text), explaining how this improves clarity and reusability.

ID: T11.G6.12
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Evaluate custom block return value design
Description: Students evaluate whether custom blocks correctly use return values versus side effects (setting variables, moving sprites, changing state). They identify blocks that should return a value but instead set a global variable (reducing reusability), and blocks that return values when they should just perform actions. They explain the trade-offs between returning values (more flexible, easier to test) and modifying state (sometimes simpler for certain operations).

Assessment example: Given 5-6 custom block implementations, students identify design issues. For example: "CalculateScore" should return the score value instead of setting a global `score` variable (more flexible); "DrawShape" correctly performs an action without returning anything; "GetPlayerX" should return the x position instead of setting a `playerX` variable.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.10: Decide whether a custom block should be a command or reporter
* T11.G5.11: Define a custom reporter block that returns a value

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Compare before and after code organization
Description: Students compare two versions of the same program: one written without custom blocks (all inline code) and one properly organized with custom blocks. They create a side-by-side comparison identifying specific improvements in the modular version: readability (easier to see structure), maintainability (changes are localized), reusability (blocks called multiple times), and testability (blocks can be tested individually). This develops critical thinking about when and why to use custom blocks.

Assessment example: Given two implementations of the same game (one 50-block monolithic script, one organized into 6 custom blocks), students write a comparison report identifying 4-5 specific ways the modular version is better, with concrete examples from the code.

Skill: Implement algorithms as reusable custom blocks
Description: Students implement ONE specific algorithm (e.g., linear search through a list, finding the maximum value in a list, computing greatest common divisor, or binary search) as a custom block with clear parameters and return values. They demonstrate that the complex algorithm is encapsulated in a reusable block that hides implementation details—users can call the block without understanding how the algorithm works internally. They test the block with multiple different inputs to verify correctness and reusability.

Assessment example: Students create a `FindMaxInList (listName)` custom reporter block that uses a loop and comparison logic to find the largest value in any list. They test it with different lists (numbers, scores, ages) to demonstrate it works with any list of numbers.

Skill: Plan a coordinated set of 3-5 custom blocks for one feature
Description: Students design (on paper or as documentation, not code yet) exactly 3-5 related custom blocks that will work together to implement ONE specific game feature or subsystem. They specify each block's interface (name, parameters, return value), describe what it does, and explain how the blocks interact (which blocks call which others). This planning skill ensures thoughtful design before implementation.

Assessment example: Students create a design document for a "Health System" with blocks: `TakeDamage (amount)`, `Heal (amount)`, `IsAlive returns: true/false`, `ShowHealthBar`, explaining that TakeDamage and Heal modify the health variable and call ShowHealthBar, while IsAlive checks if health > 0.

They test each block individually and then test the feature as a whole. They demonstrate that the blocks have consistent naming patterns, complementary parameters, and clear division of responsibilities. They show the complete feature working correctly in a demonstration project.

Assessment example: Students implement their planned "Inventory System" with blocks `AddItem (item)`, `RemoveItem (item)`, `HasItem (item) returns: true/false`, `ShowInventory`, and `ClearInventory`. They demonstrate these blocks working together in a simple collection game where players pick up items, check their inventory, and use items.

This documentation helps others use the feature without reading the implementation code, demonstrating that well-documented abstractions enable knowledge sharing and code reuse.

Assessment example: Students write documentation for their "Score System" blocks that includes: purpose ("manages player score with combo multipliers"), block list (`AddPoints (points)`, `ApplyMultiplier (multiplier)`, `ResetCombo`, `GetScore returns: current score`), example usage showing a typical scoring sequence, and notes explaining that ResetCombo should be called when the player makes a mistake.

* T11.G7.03: Implement a coordinated set of custom blocks for one feature
* T11.G5.14: Use comments to document custom block purpose

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Apply encapsulation and information hiding principles
Description: Students apply the principle of encapsulation: a well-designed custom block acts like a "black box" where users only need to know WHAT it does (its interface: name, parameters, return value) and not HOW it does it (the implementation inside). They compare examples of blocks with clean, self-contained interfaces versus blocks that require users to know internal details (like specific variable names used inside). They explain how "information hiding" makes code easier to use, understand, and modify, because changes to internal implementation won't break code that calls the block as long as the interface stays the same.

Assessment example: Students compare two implementations of a score system: (A) custom blocks with clear interfaces that hide internal score tracking in local variables, vs (B) blocks that require callers to directly manipulate global score variables. They explain why version A is better: users don't need to know how score is stored internally, and the implementation can be changed without breaking calling code.

Dependencies:
* T11.G7.01: Implement algorithms as reusable custom blocks
* T11.G6.03: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation
* T11.G6.12: Evaluate custom block return value design

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Trace and debug multi-level custom block calls
Description: Students trace through the execution of a script where custom blocks call other custom blocks (2-3 levels deep). They predict outputs, track variable values through multiple call levels, and identify bugs in the call hierarchy. This reinforces understanding of the call stack: when block A calls block B calls block C, execution goes into C, returns to B, returns to A. They practice debugging errors that only appear when blocks are called in certain combinations.

Assessment example: Given a game script where `UpdateGame` calls `MovePlayer` which calls `CheckBoundary`, and there's a bug in CheckBoundary's logic, students trace through the full execution path to find where the bug occurs, tracking position values through all three block levels.

Dependencies:
* T11.G7.03: Implement a coordinated set of custom blocks for one feature
* T11.G5.13: Debug a script with incorrect custom block calls
* T11.G6.09: Add input validation to custom blocks

ID: T11.G7.07
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Analyze Helper Block Structure
Description: Students learn that custom blocks can call other custom blocks, and identify "helper blocks" that are primarily called by other custom blocks rather than from main scripts. They understand that breaking complex blocks into smaller helper blocks improves organization and enables reuse at multiple levels. They design block structures where main blocks handle coordination and call helper blocks for specific subtasks.

Assessment example: Students create a `DrawComplexShape` block that calls helper blocks `DrawPolygon (sides)` and `MoveToNextPosition (x) (y)`. They explain that the helper blocks are reusable pieces that DrawComplexShape orchestrates to accomplish its goal.

ID: T11.G8.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Design general-purpose custom blocks with reusable interfaces
Description: Students design 3-5 custom blocks specifically for reuse across different projects or contexts. Unlike project-specific blocks, these have general-purpose interfaces that don't depend on specific sprite names, variable names, or game logic. For example, `CheckCollision (sprite1) (sprite2)` works with ANY sprites, not just "player" and "enemy". Students identify what makes a block general-purpose (parameterizing everything that varies, avoiding hard-coded values, using clear generic names) versus project-specific, and explain the benefits and limitations of general-purpose design.

Assessment example: Students create general-purpose utility blocks like `CheckOverlap (sprite1) (sprite2) returns: true/false`, `ClampValue (value) (min) (max) returns: clamped value`, and `WrapPosition (x) (y) (minX) (maxX) (minY) (maxY)` that could be used in any game project. They explain what makes these reusable (parameterized, no hard-coded game-specific values) versus a block like `CheckPlayerEnemyCollision` which is game-specific.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.03: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation
* T11.G7.03: Implement a coordinated set of custom blocks for one feature
* T11.G7.05: Apply encapsulation and information hiding principles

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Demonstrate custom block reuse across multiple contexts
Description: Students create a small library of 3-4 general-purpose custom blocks and demonstrate their reusability by using EACH block in at least TWO different contexts within a project or across two small projects. For example, a `CheckOverlap (sprite1) (sprite2)` block might be used for both player-enemy collision AND player-collectible collision. They document how the same block interface serves multiple purposes without modification, demonstrating that good abstraction enables code reuse.

Assessment example: Students create utility blocks for games (e.g., `RandomPosition (minX) (maxX) (minY) (maxY)`, `WrapAround (sprite) (minX) (maxX) (minY) (maxY)`, `ClampValue (value) (min) (max) returns: value`) and use each block in multiple different game mechanics (enemy spawning, player wrapping, collectible placement, health clamping, speed limiting), showing that good abstraction reduces code duplication across the project.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Refactor a large program into a hierarchical block structure
Description: Students take a large, unorganized program (30+ blocks) and reorganize it using a thoughtful hierarchy of custom blocks: top-level blocks that coordinate major features, mid-level blocks that implement specific features by calling helper blocks, and low-level utility blocks that handle common operations. They create a diagram showing the hierarchy (which blocks call which others) and document how the structure improves clarity and maintainability. They demonstrate that changes to low-level blocks propagate correctly through the hierarchy.

Assessment example: Students refactor a 40-block game into a hierarchy: main script calls `SetupGame`, `RunGameLoop`, `ShowGameOver`; RunGameLoop calls `ProcessInput`, `UpdateGame`, `RenderFrame`; UpdateGame calls `MovePlayer`, `UpdateEnemies`, `CheckCollisions`; and several utility blocks like `ClampPosition` and `CheckOverlap` are called by multiple blocks. They create a call diagram showing this structure.

Dependencies:
* T11.G7.03: Implement a coordinated set of custom blocks for one feature
* T11.G7.05: Apply encapsulation and information hiding principles
* T11.G7.06: Trace and debug multi-level custom block calls

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Create custom blocks that work with lists and complex data
Description: Students create custom blocks that accept and return lists or structured data, enabling powerful abstractions for managing collections. They implement blocks like `FilterList (listName) (condition) returns: filtered list`, `FindInList (listName) (value) returns: index or -1`, or blocks that manage game entities stored as lists of structured data. These blocks demonstrate that custom blocks can handle complex data types, not just simple numbers and strings.

Assessment example: Students create an inventory system using list-based custom blocks: `AddItemToInventory (itemList) (itemName) (quantity)`, `RemoveItemFromInventory (itemList) (itemName) (quantity) returns: success`, `FindItem (itemList) (itemName) returns: index`, showing how blocks can encapsulate complex list operations.

Dependencies:
* T11.G8.01: Design general-purpose custom blocks with reusable interfaces
* T10.G7.01: Use lists of lists (2D lists) to store tabular data

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Analyze trade-offs between modular and inline code
Description: Students examine two versions of a program: one organized into many custom blocks, one written mostly inline. They discuss trade-offs in readability (blocks add abstraction but also indirection), maintainability (blocks make changes easier but add complexity), code reuse (blocks enable reuse but require good design), and cognitive load (blocks can simplify OR complicate depending on design quality). They develop critical thinking about when and how much to modularize, understanding that over-modularization (too many tiny blocks) can be as problematic as under-modularization (huge monolithic scripts).

Assessment example: Students compare three versions of the same program: (A) all inline (50 blocks), (B) reasonably modular (6-8 custom blocks), (C) overly modular (20+ tiny custom blocks). They write an analysis explaining why version B is often best, but identifying scenarios where A or C might be preferable.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Create a reusable block library across projects
Description: Students create a collection of 5-8 general-purpose custom blocks designed to be copied and reused across multiple different projects. They organize these blocks into a "library" project that serves as a starting point or reference. The blocks cover common needs like collision detection, mathematical utilities, drawing helpers, or input handling. Students document each block's interface and usage, and demonstrate copying blocks from the library into 2-3 different new projects where they're immediately useful without modification.

Assessment example: Students create a "Game Utilities Library" with blocks like `CheckCollision (sprite1) (sprite2)`, `ClampValue (val) (min) (max)`, `RandomRange (min) (max)`, `WrapAround (sprite)`, `DistanceBetween (x1) (y1) (x2) (y2)`. They demonstrate copying these blocks into different game projects (platformer, shooter, puzzle game) where they work without changes.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Organization
Skill: Refactor redundant custom blocks into general versions
Description: Students examine a project with multiple similar custom blocks that have slight variations (e.g., `CheckPlayerEnemyCollision`, `CheckPlayerCoinCollision`, `CheckEnemyWallCollision`) and refactor them into one general-purpose block with appropriate parameters (e.g., `CheckCollision (sprite1) (sprite2)`). They replace all calls to the specific blocks with calls to the general block, testing that behavior remains the same. This teaches the skill of recognizing patterns in code and extracting generalizations that reduce duplication while maintaining functionality.

Assessment example: Students find a project with separate blocks for `DrawRedSquare (size)`, `DrawBlueSquare (size)`, `DrawGreenSquare (size)` and refactor into one `DrawSquare (size) (color)` block, updating all callers and verifying the program still works correctly.

Topic: T12 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Identify three types of error indicators in CreatiCode
Description: Students learn to recognize error indicators in CreatiCode: (1) **Red/orange blocks** - blocks that turn red or orange indicate invalid inputs or connections, (2) **Scripts that don't run** - clicking green flag does nothing because trigger block is missing or disconnected, (3) **Frozen sprites** - sprite stops mid-execution due to infinite loop or blocking operation. Given 4 example scripts, students classify each into one of these three error types. _Assessment: Multiple choice matching error screenshots to error type names._

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence





ID: T12.G3.01
Topic: T12 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Trace a 5-block script mentally, then run to verify prediction
Description: Students practice the trace-then-test workflow: (1) **TRACE** - Read a 5-block script (e.g., `when green flag clicked`, `go to x:0 y:0`, `move 100 steps`, `turn right 90 degrees`, `say "Hello!"`) and predict the sprite's final position and speech without running it. (2) **TEST** - Run the script and compare actual behavior to prediction. (3) **ISOLATE** - If prediction was wrong, identify which block caused the surprise by clicking blocks one at a time. _Assessment: Predict final x,y coordinates and message before running; auto-graded by prediction accuracy._

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Identify sprite visual properties and predict changes
Description: Identify that sprites have three key visual properties that can be changed with code: **size** (how big/small, measured in percent where 100% is normal), **position** (where on stage, measured in x and y coordinates), and **visibility** (shown or hidden). Predict how a sprite will look when these properties change. Example: "If size changes from 100% to 50%, the sprite appears half as big. If `hide` runs, the sprite becomes invisible." This foundational understanding prepares you to use blocks that modify these properties.

Skill: Use size blocks to scale sprites larger or smaller
Description: Use `set size to (100) %` to set a sprite's size to an exact percentage (100% = original size, 50% = half size, 200% = double size). Use `change size by (10)` to increase size by 10% from current value, or `change size by (-10)` to decrease. Trace what happens: if a sprite starts at 100% and `change size by (20)` runs, the sprite becomes 120%. Use size changes to create visual emphasis (make important characters larger), show distance (smaller = farther away), or prepare for size animations.

Skill: Edit sprite costumes using the paint editor tools
Description: Access the paint editor by clicking the "Costumes" tab for any sprite. Use the visual design tools to manually customize sprite appearances: **brush** for freehand drawing, **circle/oval** for round shapes, **rectangle/square** for boxes, **text** tool for adding words, **fill** for coloring areas, and **eraser** for removing parts. These manual edits become the sprite's permanent appearance and are saved with the project. The paint editor is a design tool (not coding) - you create costumes before running code. Multiple costumes on a sprite enable costume-switching animations. Later skills teach programmatic drawing with code blocks.

Skill: Position sprites instantly with go to x y blocks
Description: Use `go to x: (0) y: (0)` to instantly teleport a sprite to specific stage coordinates (no animation - instant jump). **Coordinate system:** (0, 0) is stage center, positive X moves right (up to 240), negative X moves left (down to -240), positive Y moves up (up to 180), negative Y moves down (down to -180). Trace examples: `go to x: (100) y: (50)` places sprite in upper-right area. `go to x: (-150) y: (-100)` places sprite in lower-left area. Use this block to set starting positions or instantly reposition characters during scene changes.

Skill: Animate smooth movement with glide blocks
Description: Use `glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (50)` to animate a sprite smoothly moving to a target position over a specified duration. Unlike `go to x: y:` which teleports instantly, glide creates visible motion animation. **Duration controls speed:** 0.5 secs = fast/snappy, 1-2 secs = normal, 3+ secs = slow/dramatic. Trace the animation: sprite smoothly slides from current position to target over the duration. Chain multiple glides to create paths: `glide (1) secs to x: (0) y: (0)` then `glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (0)` creates an L-shaped path. Use for character walking, flying, approaching, or any animated movement.

Skill: Create size animation using repeat loops
Description: Combine `change size by (10)` inside a `repeat` loop to create smooth grow/shrink animations. Trace this script: `repeat (10) { change size by (5) }` - the sprite grows by 5% ten times, ending 50% larger. For shrinking, use negative values: `repeat (10) { change size by (-5) }`. Add `wait (0.1) seconds` inside the loop to control animation speed: shorter waits = faster animation. Debug common issues: animation too fast (add wait blocks), sprite gets too big (reduce repeat count or size change amount), animation restarts at original size (need to reset size at start with `set size to (100) %`).

Skill: Create frame-by-frame animation with costume switching
Description: Use `switch costume to [costume2 v]` to change a sprite to a specific costume, or `next costume` to cycle through all costumes in order (loops back to first after last). Create frame-by-frame animations by combining costume changes with loops and waits: `repeat (8) { next costume, wait (0.1) seconds }` creates an 8-frame animation cycling at 10 fps. Design multi-costume sprites for: walking cycles (4+ leg positions), talking mouths (open/closed), blinking eyes (open/half/closed), or transformation sequences. Trace a 4-costume walk cycle: costume1 (left foot) → costume2 (center) → costume3 (right foot) → costume4 (center) → repeats.

Description: Use `think [Hmm...] for (2) seconds text size (16) [#FFFFFFFF] background [#000000FF] edge [#FFFFFFFF]` to show internal monologue in cloud-shaped thought bubbles. Parameters work identically to say blocks. **Visual difference:** think bubbles have cloud shapes (thoughts), say bubbles have pointed tails (speech). Identify when to use each: `say` = words spoken aloud that others hear, `think` = private thoughts that only the audience sees. Use think for character reasoning ("I should go left..."), secret plans, reactions ("That was surprising!"), or narration. Trace a scene: character sees treasure → `think [Wow! I found it!]` (private reaction).

Skill: Sequence multiple say blocks for monologue
Description: Stack multiple `say` blocks in sequence to create a character monologue (one character speaking multiple lines). Each say block runs after the previous one finishes. Trace this sequence: `say [Hello!] for (2) secs`, `say [My name is Alex.] for (2) secs`, `say [Nice to meet you!] for (2) secs` - the character says three lines, each appearing for 2 seconds in order. Calculate total duration: 3 blocks × 2 seconds = 6 seconds total. Debug timing: if dialogue feels rushed, increase duration; if too slow, decrease it. Use monologues for introductions, explanations, or storytelling narration.

Skill: Use wait blocks to control timing between actions
Description: Use `wait (1) seconds` to pause script execution, creating deliberate timing gaps between actions. Trace: `glide (1) secs to x: 100 y: 0`, `wait (0.5) seconds`, `say [I made it!] for (2) secs` - sprite moves, pauses briefly, then speaks. **Timing uses:** dramatic pause before reveal, gap between character movements, delay before response. Calculate timing: `say` for 2 secs + `wait` 1 sec = 3 seconds before next action. Debug: animation feels too fast → add wait blocks; animation feels too slow → reduce wait duration. Short waits (0.2-0.5 secs) for transitions, longer waits (1-3 secs) for dramatic effect.

Description: Use `start sound [pop v]` to play a sound effect while the script continues immediately (non-blocking). Use `play sound [meow v] until done` when the script should wait for the sound to finish before continuing. **Sound types:** background music (loops), sound effects (footsteps, doors, magic), ambient sounds (rain, wind). Trace: `start sound [music v]` + `say [Hello!]` - music starts AND speech appears simultaneously. Compare: `play sound [fanfare v] until done` + `say [I won!]` - fanfare plays completely, THEN speech appears. Use `stop all sounds` to silence everything.

Skill: Use broadcasts to coordinate scene changes across sprites
Description: Use `broadcast [Scene2]` to send a message that triggers scripts in ALL sprites that have `when I receive [Scene2]`. This is the key mechanism for scene changes in multi-sprite stories. **How it works:** one sprite broadcasts → ALL sprites with matching `when I receive` run their scripts simultaneously. Trace: SceneManager broadcasts "Scene2" → House sprite hides, Forest sprite shows, Character sprite moves to forest position. **Architecture:** each sprite handles its own response to scene broadcasts (show/hide/move/speak).

Skill: Change stage backdrop to match scene changes
Description: Use `switch backdrop to [Forest v]` to change the stage background image. The Stage is a special sprite that can have multiple backdrops (like costumes for sprites). Add backdrops via the Stage's "Backdrops" tab. **Coordinate with scenes:** in Stage scripts, add `when I receive [Scene2]` → `switch backdrop to [Forest v]`. Trace scene change: broadcast "Scene2" → sprites respond (show/hide/move) AND Stage responds (switches backdrop) → entire visual scene changes. Use `next backdrop` to cycle through backdrops in order. Design backdrops for each story location: house interior, forest, castle, etc.

Skill: Control character visibility with hide and show blocks
Description: Use `hide` to make a sprite invisible and `show` to make it visible again. **Visibility vs deletion:** `hide` keeps the sprite in the project but invisible; you can show it again. Hidden sprites still run scripts but cannot be clicked. **Scene management pattern:** characters not in current scene should be hidden. Trace: `when I receive [Scene2]` → `hide` on Village sprite; `when I receive [Scene1]` → `show` on Village sprite. **Initialization:** at green flag, show sprites that should be visible in Scene1, hide sprites that shouldn't. Debug: sprite doesn't appear → check if `show` runs at the right time.

Skill: Create textbox widgets for player text input
Description: Use `add textbox at X (0) Y (-50) width (200) height (30) as [nameInput]` to create a text input field where players can type responses. **Parameters:** X/Y position, width/height dimensions, widget name for reference. Textboxes allow players to enter their name, type answers, or input story choices. Trace: widget created → player types "Alex" in the textbox → text is stored in the widget. Position textboxes where players expect input fields (near prompts or instructions). Use descriptive widget names like "nameInput" or "answerBox" to keep code readable.

Skill: Show, hide, and remove widgets dynamically
Description: Control widget visibility: `show widget [nameInput v]` makes visible, `hide widget [nameInput v]` makes invisible (widget still exists, retains value), `remove widget [nameInput v]` permanently deletes widget. **Use cases:** hide textbox after player submits name, show choice buttons only when needed, remove widgets when changing scenes. Trace: `hide widget [nameInput v]` → textbox disappears but value still readable → `show widget [nameInput v]` → textbox reappears with same value. **Pattern:** create widgets at scene start, hide/show as needed, remove when no longer needed.

Skill: Read widget values into variables for story use
Description: Use `set [playerName v] to (value of widget [nameInput v])` to capture the player's text input into a variable. The `(value of widget [widgetName v])` reporter returns whatever text the player typed. Trace: player types "Alex" in textbox → `set [playerName v] to (value of widget [nameInput v])` → playerName variable now contains "Alex". Use the variable throughout your story: `say (join [Hello, ] (playerName))` outputs "Hello, Alex". **Timing:** read widget value AFTER player has entered their input (use button click or wait).

Skill: Create branching story paths with button widgets
Description: Use `add button [Go Left] at X (-100) Y (-100) width (100) height (40) as [btnLeft]` to create clickable buttons. Use `when widget [btnLeft v] clicked` event to detect clicks and `broadcast [LeftPath]` to trigger that story branch. **Pattern for choices:** create 2+ buttons for options → each button's click handler broadcasts a different message → sprites respond to broadcasts with different story content. Trace: player clicks "Go Left" button → `when widget [btnLeft v] clicked` runs → `broadcast [LeftPath]` → all sprites with `when I receive [LeftPath]` execute their left-path scripts.

Skill: Coordinate multi-sprite dialogue with synchronized waits
Description: Create back-and-forth conversations by synchronizing wait blocks across sprites. **Pattern:** both sprites start on same event (green flag or broadcast) → Sprite A: `say [Hello!] for (2) secs` → Sprite B: `wait (2) secs`, `say [Hi there!] for (2) secs` → Sprite A: `wait (4) secs`, `say [How are you?] for (2) secs`. Trace timing: Sprite A speaks (0-2 sec), Sprite B waits then speaks (2-4 sec), Sprite A waits then speaks (4-6 sec). Calculate wait times: each sprite waits for total duration of all previous speeches. Debug: dialogue overlaps → increase wait times; gaps too long → decrease wait times.

Skill: Run parallel actions using multiple scripts on same sprite
Description: Add multiple `when green flag clicked` scripts to the SAME sprite to run actions simultaneously. **Script 1:** handles walking animation (glide + costume changes). **Script 2:** handles dialogue (say blocks). Both scripts run in parallel when green flag is clicked. Trace: green flag → Script 1 starts glide AND Script 2 starts speech → character walks AND talks at same time. **Use cases:** character moves while speaking, background music plays while story progresses, animation loops while player makes choices. Compare to sequential: stacking blocks in one script makes them run one after another; separate scripts make them run in parallel.

Skill: Apply graphics effects for visual atmosphere and transitions
Description: Use `set [ghost v] effect to (50)` for instant effect or `change [ghost v] effect by (10)` for gradual change. **Effects:** ghost (0-100): transparency for fade effects, ghosts, dreams; brightness (-100 to 100): dark/light for night/day moods; color: hue shift for magical transformations. **Fade-out pattern:** `repeat (10) { change [ghost v] effect by (10), wait (0.1) secs }` - sprite fades to invisible. **Fade-in pattern:** `set [ghost v] effect to (100)`, `repeat (10) { change [ghost v] effect by (-10), wait (0.1) secs }`. Use `clear graphic effects` to reset all effects to normal. Trace effect values through animation loops.

Skill: Debug and test multi-sprite scene coordination
Description: Ensure smooth scene transitions by systematically checking all sprite responses. **Testing checklist per scene:** which sprites show, which hide, sprite positions, costume states, backdrop. **Common bugs:** sprite left visible in wrong scene (missing hide), sprite in wrong position (missing go to), backdrop doesn't change (Stage script missing). Use `broadcast [Scene] and wait` when the script needs to pause until all sprites finish their scene setup. **Debug strategy:** test each scene transition individually, verify every sprite's state after each broadcast. Plan scene coordination with a table: columns = scenes, rows = sprites, cells = show/hide/position.

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Broadcast action events to coordinate group animations
Description: Use `broadcast [Dance]` to trigger the same animation across multiple sprites simultaneously. **Pattern:** one sprite broadcasts an action → all sprites with `when I receive [Dance]` run their dance animation. **Examples:** `broadcast [Celebrate]` makes all characters cheer; `broadcast [FreezeAll]` stops all character movement. Design coordinated group animations: each sprite has its own `when I receive [Dance]` script with character-specific dance moves, but all dance at the same time. Compare to scene broadcasts: scene broadcasts change what's visible; action broadcasts trigger coordinated behaviors within a scene.

Skill: Use broadcast and wait for strict sequential timing
Description: Use `broadcast [Action] and wait` to pause the current script until ALL scripts triggered by that broadcast complete. **Compare:** `broadcast [Walk]` continues immediately (parallel); `broadcast [Walk] and wait` pauses until walking finishes (sequential). **Cutscene pattern:** `broadcast [HeroWalks] and wait`, `broadcast [HeroSpeaks] and wait`, `broadcast [VillainAppears] and wait` - each action completes before next begins. Trace: `broadcast [Walk] and wait` → current script pauses → Hero sprite's walk script runs (3 secs) → walk script ends → current script resumes → next block runs. Use for cutscenes, dramatic reveals, or any sequence where order matters.

Skill: Simulate camera panning by moving all sprites together
Description: Create the illusion of camera movement by moving all sprites (and backdrop elements) in the opposite direction. **Camera pan right:** all sprites `change x by (-5)` - sprites move left, creating illusion camera moved right. **Implementation:** `broadcast [PanRight]` → each sprite has `when I receive [PanRight]` with `repeat (20) { change x by (-5), wait (0.05) }`. All sprites move together in sync. **Multi-layer parallax:** background sprites move less (change x by -2), foreground sprites move more (change x by -7) for depth illusion. Trace: camera "pans right" 100 pixels → all sprites end up 100 pixels left of where they started.

Skill: Understand and plan visual layer composition
Description: Identify the fixed layer order in CreatiCode: **back to front:** Stage backdrop → Printed text → Sprites → Widgets. Sprites have relative layers (changeable), but always appear behind widgets and above printed text. **Design implications:** use backdrops for scene backgrounds, print blocks for floating annotations (behind characters), sprites for characters/objects, widgets for UI buttons/labels (always in front). Predict visual overlap: a character sprite will always appear in front of printed text but behind buttons. Plan your visual composition by assigning elements to appropriate layers. Debug: text covered by sprite → use widget label instead of print.

Description: Use `go to [front v] layer` to bring sprite in front of ALL other sprites, `go to [back v] layer` to send behind all sprites. Use `go [forward v] (1) layers` to move up one layer relative to current, `go [backward v] (1) layers` to move down. **Initialization pattern:** at green flag, set each sprite's layer - background sprites `go to [back v] layer`, character sprites `go to [front v] layer`. Trace: SkySprite at back, TreeSprite in middle, HeroSprite at front → Hero appears in front of Tree, Tree in front of Sky. Debug: character hidden behind scenery → add `go to [front v] layer` to character's init.

Skill: Create dynamic dialogue by joining text and variables
Description: Use `join [Hello, ] (playerName)` to concatenate text strings with variables, creating personalized dialogue. Trace: playerName = "Alex" → `join [Hello, ] (playerName)` returns "Hello, Alex". **Nested joins:** `join (join [You have ] (score)) [ points!]` creates "You have 50 points!". Use in say blocks: `say (join [Welcome, ] (playerName)) for (2) secs`. **Applications:** personalized greetings, score displays, dynamic story content that includes player choices or status. Debug: extra spaces → check spacing in literal text strings; missing variable value → verify variable is set before join.

Trace: message = "Hello" → display builds: "H", "He", "Hel", "Hell", "Hello". Adjust wait time for typing speed: 0.02 = fast typing, 0.1 = slow dramatic reveal. Use for: dramatic dialogue, story narration, terminal/computer effects. Debug: letters missing → check loop count matches message length.

Skill: Track cumulative player choices with variables
Description: Use variables to track player decisions across the story for later consequences. **Pattern:** create tracking variable (Trust, Karma, Friendship) → when player makes choice, adjust variable (`change [Trust v] by (10)` for positive choice, `change [Trust v] by (-5)` for negative). **Example:** "Help the stranger?" - Yes adds 10 Trust, No subtracts 5. Trace choices: player helps twice, ignores once → Trust = 10 + 10 - 5 = 15. Later in story, check accumulated value to determine outcomes. Multiple trackers: separate variables for different relationships or moral dimensions.

Description: Use `draw oval at x (0) y (0) width (100) height (100) fill [#E2F9F2FF] border [#F44399FF] width (1) rotation (0)` for circles and ovals. **Circle vs oval:** width = height creates circle; width ≠ height creates oval. Position (x, y) is center point. Combine shapes for patterns: `repeat (5)` with `draw oval...` and `change x by (30)` creates a row of circles. **Use cases:** status indicators (filled circles for hearts/lives), decorative patterns, dynamic icons. Trace: `draw oval` at (0,0) width 50 height 50 → 50-pixel circle centered on costume center.

Description: Store dialogue lines in a list for data-driven storytelling. **Setup:** `add [Hello there!] to [dialogue v]`, `add [How are you?] to [dialogue v]`, etc. **Playback:** `set [i v] to (1)`, `repeat (length of [dialogue v])` with `say (item (i) of [dialogue v]) for (2) secs`, `change [i v] by (1)`. **Benefits:** edit dialogue by changing list items (no code changes); extend scenes by adding list items; reuse dialogue code for different conversations. Trace: dialogue list has 3 items → loop runs 3 times → character says all 3 lines. Design dialogue as data, separate from animation code.

Dependencies:
* T14.G6.01: Implement animation state machines with variables
* T10.G4.01: Use lists for dynamic data storage

Topic: T14 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Trigger story branches with voice commands
Description: Process speech recognition results to control story flow. **Pattern:** `if <(text from speech) contains [yes]> then broadcast [AcceptQuest]`. Use `contains` not `=` because speech may include extra words ("yes please" matches "yes"). **Handle variations:** `if <or <(text) contains [yes]> <(text) contains [yeah]>>`. **Robust design:** check for synonyms, handle unclear input with "I didn't understand". **Examples:** "Go left" → LeftPath, "Attack" → CombatScene, "Yes" → AcceptQuest. Create immersive voice-driven interactive fiction.

Dependencies:
* T14.G6.05: Accept voice input with speech recognition

Skill: Animate widgets for visual feedback
Description: Animate widgets for visual feedback and smooth transitions. Use "move widget [NAME] to X Y in T seconds" to slide widgets in from the side. Use "set transparency for widget [NAME] to (T)% in (N) seconds [blocking v]" to create fade effects. Transparency creates fade effects (0% = fully visible, 100% = invisible but still present). This is different from "set visibility" which instantly shows or hides widgets. Use transparency for smooth fade-in/fade-out animations; use visibility for instant show/hide. Use "scale widget [NAME] to width (W)% height (H)% in (T) seconds" to grow or shrink widgets. Use "rotate widget [NAME] by (D) degrees in (T) seconds" to spin widgets for attention-grabbing effects. Combine with "when pointer enters widget" for hover effects. Animations improve user experience by making interfaces feel responsive and polished.

Skill: Update streaming chat messages
Description: Use "update last chat message to [MESSAGE] for chat [CHATNAME v]" block to modify the most recent message in the chat history panel. This block replaces the text of the last message with new text without adding a new message entry. This is useful for streaming AI responses (where the chatbot's message builds up word by word), correcting errors in the last message, or updating status messages (changing "Typing..." to the actual message). Unlike appending which adds a new message, updating modifies the existing last message in place. This creates a smooth typing effect for chatbots or real-time message updates.

Skill: Create a local 2-player game on one keyboard
Description: Students create a simple game where two players use different keys on the same keyboard (e.g., Player 1 uses arrow keys, Player 2 uses WASD). They implement separate controls for each player using key press conditionals. They use variables to track each player's state independently. They use broadcasts to coordinate actions between player sprites (e.g., "Player 1 scored" message). This introduces the concept of multiple agents before teaching networked multiplayer.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Explain host and client roles
Description: Students explain that in CreatiCode multiplayer, one player creates the game (the "host") and others join (the "clients"). They describe how the host's computer runs the authoritative game state and clients synchronize with it. They compare this to real-world examples (host of a party, server at restaurant, teacher in classroom). They explain why having one authoritative source prevents conflicts when multiple players make changes simultaneously.

Dependencies:

ID: T18.G5.05
Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Explain synchronization basics
Description: Students explain that "synchronization" means keeping game state consistent across all players' screens. They describe how when one player moves, that movement must be sent to all other players so everyone sees the same position. They identify what needs synchronization (player positions, scores, game events) versus what doesn't (local UI, sound effects on individual machines). They explain why network delay means synchronization isn't instant.

Skill: Diagram how CreatiCode multiplayer works
Description: Students diagram the technical details of how CreatiCode multiplayer works. They explain that game rooms exist on servers, the host creates the authoritative game state, and clients connect and synchronize. They compare single-player (one instance) to multiplayer (multiple instances connected). They diagram the flow: player actions → network messages → synchronization → all players see changes. They explain why some games work better as multiplayer (competitive, cooperative) than others (story-driven, puzzle).

Skill: Explain the host-client model and game rooms
Description: Students explain the detailed responsibilities of hosts versus clients. The host creates the game room, runs the authoritative game logic, validates actions, and broadcasts updates. Clients send input requests and receive state updates. They explain that game rooms are containers that hold connected players and shared game state. They explain why the host must validate actions (prevent cheating) and why clients can't directly modify game state. They identify which parts of their game should run on host versus all clients.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Explain sprite replication in multiplayer games
Description: Students explain that when a sprite is registered with the multiplayer game, it appears on all connected players' screens automatically. The "original" sprite exists on the player who registered it, and "replicate" sprites appear on other players' screens. They describe how position updates on the original automatically synchronize to replicates. They explain why replication is necessary (so all players see the same game world) and how it works (network messages broadcast position/state changes).

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Trace how code runs on original vs replicate sprites
Description: Students trace that code blocks run only on the original sprite by default, not on replicate sprites. Input controls (arrow keys) should only affect the local player's sprite (the original), not remote players' replicates. They test this by adding print statements and observing which window shows output. They explain why this prevents conflicts (multiple players trying to control the same sprite) and allows each player to control only their own sprite while seeing others' sprites as replicates.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Classify Dynamic vs Static sprites in multiplayer games
Description: Students classify the difference between Dynamic and Static sprites in multiplayer. Dynamic sprites are for moving objects (players, enemies, projectiles) and their positions synchronize continuously. Static sprites are for fixed objects (walls, platforms, obstacles) and their positions never change, using less network bandwidth. They categorize at least 10 game objects as Dynamic or Static. They explain the performance trade-off: Dynamic sprites synchronize smoothly but use more network traffic, Static sprites are efficient but can't move.

ID: T18.G6.00E
Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Compare collision shapes (Rectangle vs Circle) in multiplayer games
Description: Students learn that multiplayer sprites need collision shapes for hit detection: Rectangle for box-shaped objects (walls, crates, platforms) and Circle for round objects (balls, circular players). They understand that collision shapes must match sprite appearance for accurate gameplay. They test collision detection with both shapes and observe differences. They explain why choosing the right shape matters: better accuracy, smoother gameplay, and fair collision detection across all players.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Compare automatic vs manual synchronization mechanisms
Description: Students compare the technical details of how CreatiCode synchronizes game state. They explain that synchronized movement blocks automatically send position updates through the network. Broadcasting messages explicitly synchronizes events (player scored, game started). They compare automatic synchronization (positions of Dynamic sprites) to manual synchronization (broadcasts for custom events). They explain when to use each: continuous data (movement) uses synchronized blocks, discrete events (scoring, collecting) use broadcasts.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Explain lag and latency in multiplayer games
Description: Students explain that "lag" or "latency" is the delay between an action and seeing it on other players' screens. They describe how this delay is caused by network message travel time (physical distance, internet speed). They identify how lag affects gameplay: high lag makes games feel unresponsive, low lag feels smooth and immediate. They test games on different server locations and observe lag differences. They explain why some games are more affected by lag than others (fast-paced action games vs turn-based strategy).

Dependencies:
* T05.G5.01: Write clear user needs and requirements for a small app

ID: T18.G6.00H
Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Explain the role of game servers
Description: Students explain that servers are computers that relay messages between players and store game rooms. CreatiCode provides servers in different geographic locations (US-East, US-West, Europe, Asia). They explain that all players must connect to the same server to play together. They explain why server location matters (closer servers = lower lag) and why servers are necessary (relay messages, maintain game room, validate actions). They identify which server location is best for their geography and play group.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Explain player roles in multiplayer games
Description: Students explain that "roles" are labels assigned to players (e.g., "red team", "builder", "seeker", "guard") that can be used to give different behaviors or responsibilities. They explain that roles are optional text labels that don't automatically change behavior - developers must write code to check roles and act accordingly. They identify examples of role-based games (asymmetric games, team games, job-based games). They explain how roles enable game variety: players can have different abilities, objectives, or team assignments.

Topic: T18 – Multiplayer Apps
Skill: Compare multiplayer games to cloud variables
Description: Students compare two ways to share data online: multiplayer games (real-time synchronization, game rooms, multiple players see changes instantly) versus cloud variables (persistent storage, slower updates, no game rooms). They understand when to use each: multiplayer for interactive real-time games with simultaneous players, cloud variables for leaderboards, saved progress, or asynchronous sharing. They explain the technical differences: multiplayer uses game servers and rooms, cloud variables use database storage.

Description: Students open two browser windows or tabs to test their multiplayer game by creating and joining as two separate players. They verify that actions in one window appear in the other window (movement, messages, score changes). They use this testing method throughout development to catch synchronization issues early. They understand that two-window testing simulates real multiplayer but both instances run on the same computer, so network lag is minimal. They explain why testing with actual network delay (different computers) is also important.

Skill: Explain sprite registration purpose
Description: Students explain that sprites must be "registered" with the multiplayer game server to become visible to other players. Unregistered sprites exist only locally and other players cannot see them. Registration creates replicate copies on all other players' screens that automatically synchronize position and appearance. They identify which sprites should be registered (players, enemies, shared objects) versus which should stay local (UI elements, local effects, background decorations). They explain why registration is necessary for multiplayer gameplay.

Skill: Add a Dynamic sprite to the multiplayer game
Description: Students use the add this sprite to game block with Dynamic mode to register moving sprites (players, enemies, projectiles) with the multiplayer game server. They understand that Dynamic sprites continuously synchronize their positions across all players. They test with two windows to verify that when a Dynamic sprite moves in one window, its position updates in the other window automatically. They explain when to use Dynamic mode (any sprite that will move during gameplay) and its trade-off (smooth synchronization but higher network usage).

Skill: Add a Static sprite to the multiplayer game
Description: Students use the add this sprite to game block with Static mode to register non-moving sprites (walls, platforms, obstacles) with the multiplayer game server. They understand that Static sprites do not synchronize position updates, saving network bandwidth. They test with two windows to verify that Static sprites appear in both windows but do not send position updates when moved. They explain when to use Static mode (sprites that never move) and its benefit (efficient, low network usage). They identify the limitation: Static sprites cannot move during gameplay.

Skill: Initialize sprites when they join using "when added to game"
Description: Students use the when added to game hat block to run initialization code after a sprite is successfully registered with the multiplayer game server. They set starting positions, display names, or announce arrivals to other players. They understand this event fires after the add sprite block completes and the server confirms registration. They test with two windows to verify initialization runs at the right time. They explain why this event is important (ensures sprite is registered before initializing) versus running code immediately after the add block (might run before server confirms).

Description: Students configure multiplayer collision blocks to detect when the tagger touches a runner. They set collision behavior to "continue" (players pass through each other, not stop) and trigger a "tagged" message. They attach parameters to identify which player was tagged. They test with two windows by moving players into collision and verifying the message fires.

Skill: Choose between "All Sprites" and "Exclude Replicate" broadcast modes
Description: Students learn the two broadcast modes in multiplayer games. "All Sprites" mode sends the message to all sprites on all clients (originals and replicates). "Exclude Replicate" mode sends only to original sprites (skips replicates). They test both modes and observe the difference: "All Sprites" may cause duplicate actions if replicates also respond, "Exclude Replicate" ensures each player's code runs only once. They choose the appropriate mode based on whether they want actions to run on all sprites or only on original/controlling sprites.

Skill: Configure stop vs continue collision behavior
Description: Students learn the two basic collision behaviors in multiplayer collision blocks. "Stop" makes both sprites stop moving when they collide (solid collision for walls, obstacles). "Continue" lets sprites pass through each other (trigger zones, collectibles, pass-through collisions). They test both behaviors and observe differences. They choose appropriate behavior based on game design: solid objects use "stop", triggers and pass-through objects use "continue".

The workflow: (1) user asks question, (2) semantic search finds top K (3-5) relevant database entries, (3) entries are formatted and sent to ChatGPT as context, (4) ChatGPT synthesizes the information into a natural language answer, (5) system displays answer with source citations. This demonstrates how modern AI systems combine retrieval (finding relevant information) and generation (creating coherent responses) to answer questions accurately with current information.

## GRADE 6 SKILLS




ID: T22.G6.01.01
Topic: T22 – AI Perception
Skill: Capture a single spoken phrase with basic speech recognition
Description: Students use the basic speech recognition flow: `start recognizing speech in [English (United States) v] record as []` (with default language), wait briefly, then `end speech recognition` to capture a single spoken word or phrase.

Skill: Map hand detection table structure
Description: Students map the hand detection table structure: 47 rows per detected hand organized into three sections: (1) rows 1-5 contain finger summaries (thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky) with columns [hand, part, curl, dir, x, y, z], (2) rows 6-26 contain 2D landmark positions, (3) rows 27-47 contain 3D landmark positions. They identify which row contains specific finger data and trace that curl ranges from 0° (fully closed/fist) to 180° (fully extended/straight), direction ranges from 0° to 360° indicating pointing direction, and x/y are screen coordinates while z is depth. They practice locating specific data: "Which row has index finger curl?" (row 2). IMPORTANT: Curl and dir values are ONLY available in rows 1-5 (finger summaries), NOT in the landmark rows.

Description: Students extend hand detection by reading the direction (dir) column from the hand detection table (rows 1-5). Each finger summary has a direction indicating which way it's pointing (up, down, left, right). They combine curl and direction to recognize complex gestures: "thumbs up" = thumb extended (curl > 170) + pointing up, "peace sign" = index and middle extended + pointing up.

They understand that detection consumes resources (camera, processing) and should be stopped when: switching to different input mode, pausing the application, or when detection task is complete. They use a stop block or proper event handling to end detection gracefully and release the camera. They implement detection lifecycle: start → use → stop, preventing resource leaks.

They use conditional blocks to check if a value exceeds boundaries and reset it to the boundary value: `if position < 0 then set position to 0`, `if position > 480 then set position to 480`. They apply clamping to prevent sprites from moving off-screen, keep angles within 0-360 range, and filter out impossible sensor values that indicate errors.

Skill: Implement debouncing to filter rapid fluctuations
Description: Students implement debouncing to ignore rapid changes in sensor data. They require a value to remain stable for a minimum time (e.g., 0.5 seconds) before accepting it as valid. For gesture detection, they check that a gesture is maintained for multiple consecutive frames (3+ frames) before triggering an action. This prevents false positives from brief sensor noise or accidental hand movements. They understand the trade-off between reliability and responsiveness.

They track the time since last valid sensor reading and trigger recovery actions if too much time passes (e.g., 2 seconds with no hand detected). Recovery actions include: displaying "hand not detected" message, switching to alternative input mode, or restarting the detection system. They handle scenarios where hands temporarily leave the camera frame and distinguish between brief dropouts (ignore) and extended absence (notify user).

Description: Students compare two detection patterns: (1) continuous polling in forever loop (constantly read table and update), (2) event-driven (start detection, wait for specific condition, then act). They implement both patterns with hand detection: continuous mode moves sprite smoothly following hand, event-driven mode triggers action when gesture detected. They discuss trade-offs: continuous is smooth but CPU-intensive, event-driven is efficient but may miss quick gestures.

Description: Students analyze familiar board and card games (Chutes and Ladders, Candy Land, Sorry!, Go Fish). For each game, they identify what makes it "lucky": dice, spinner, or card shuffling. They classify 3-4 games by asking: "Is this game more about luck or skill?" They explain that random elements (dice, spinners, shuffled cards) make outcomes uncertain.

They modify the script in one of these ways: (1) change the colors to different colors, (2) change from 2 outcomes to 3 outcomes by adjusting the range and adding another if block, or (3) change from colors to numbers.

Example: If red appeared 12 times out of 50, that's (12/50)×100 = 24%. They display all percentages and compare: Does each color appear about 25% of the time for a fair 4-color spinner?

They observe: With 50 trials, percentages might be 20%, 35%, 22%, 23% (uneven). With 500 trials, they're closer to 25%, 26%, 24%, 25% (more even).

Description: Students count frequencies for each sum (2-12) from their two-dice data and create a bar chart. They observe that 7 appears most often and explain why: there are 6 ways to make 7 (1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1) but only 1 way to make 2 (1+1) or 12 (6+6). This reveals that compound events aren't equally likely even when individual events are.

The agent has: (1) x,y position variables, (2) a facing direction variable (0=up, 90=right, etc.), (3) an energy level that decreases each step.
