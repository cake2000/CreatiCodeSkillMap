### T21.G5.02 (NEW)
**ID:** T21.G5.02
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Search AI image library for ready-made assets
**Description:** Students use the `search for AI image of [TYPE] with query [QUERY]` block to find ready-made images from CreatiCode's AI image library. They learn to specify TYPE (Object, Character, or Backdrop) and write effective QUERY terms (e.g., "cat" vs "orange cat sitting"). Students complete 5 searches, evaluate results, refine queries for better matches, and import selected images as costumes or backdrops. This simpler introduction to AI media generation precedes DALL-E's custom generation in G5.03.

**Dependencies:**
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T21.G4.01: Rewrite prompts to be safe, specific, and privacy-friendly

**ID:** T21.G5.03
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Generate a custom AI image with DALL-E using structured prompts
**Description:** Students use the command block `OpenAI DALL-E: generate costume image name [NAME] description [DESC] with resolution [RES]` to create one custom image from a structured prompt. Resolution options are 256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024. Students practice 3 generations: (1) simple prompt from G3.02 structure, (2) refined prompt with more detail, (3) style-specific prompt (e.g., "cartoon style" or "realistic photo"). They compare results to expectations and identify which prompt elements most influenced the output. This skill focuses on the command version (creates costume directly) rather than the reporter version (returns URL).

**Dependencies:**
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T21.G4.01: Rewrite prompts to be safe, specific, and privacy-friendly

**Description:** Students use the `say [TEXT] in [LANGUAGE] as [VOICETYPE] speed (SPEEDRATIO) pitch (PITCHRATIO) volume (VOLUMERATIO) store sound as [SOUNDNAME]` block to convert text to speech. They experiment with: (1) Different languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, etc.), (2) Voice types (Male, Female, Male2, Female2, Boy, Girl), (3) Speed (50-150%), (4) Pitch (50-150%), (5) Volume (0-100%). Students complete 5 experiments testing each parameter, describe the effect of each change, and identify optimal settings for different contexts (storytelling narration, robot character, urgent announcement, calm meditation guide). They also learn to use `stop speaking` to halt speech playback and optionally store generated speech using the SOUNDNAME parameter for reuse.

**Dependencies:**
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T21.G2.01: Recognize that computers can speak and listen

### T21.G5.05
**ID:** T21.G5.05
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Test factors affecting speech-to-text accuracy
**Description:** Students use `start recognizing speech in [LANGUAGE]`, `end speech recognition`, and `text from speech` blocks to conduct structured experiments testing speech-to-text accuracy. They design 8 test conditions varying: (1) Speech clarity (clear enunciation vs mumbling), (2) Background noise (quiet vs noisy environment), (3) Speaking speed (normal vs very fast), (4) Microphone distance (close vs far), (5) Language match (speaking English with English setting vs mismatch), (6) Complex vocabulary (simple words vs technical terms), (7) Sentence length (short vs long), (8) Multiple speakers vs single speaker. For each test, students record hypothesis, observed accuracy (0-100%), and explanation. This hands-on experiment replaces the conceptual-only G5.04 and makes learning measurable.

**Dependencies:**
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T21.G2.01: Recognize that computers can speak and listen

### T21.G5.06
**ID:** T21.G5.06
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Explain content moderation necessity with examples
**Description:** Students discuss why AI-generated images and text need human review before public sharing. They identify 5 potential issues: (1) Inappropriate content (violence, mature themes), (2) Bias (stereotypical representations), (3) Misinformation (false facts presented as real), (4) Privacy violations (resemblance to real people), (5) Quality problems (technical glitches, unclear output). For each issue, students provide one real or realistic example and explain the harm if unmoderated. They then design a 3-step review process (AI moderation check → human review → approval/rejection) and explain why both automated and human checks are necessary. This moves from G5 to align with other conceptual skills before hands-on G6 moderation blocks.

**Dependencies:**
* T21.G4.01: Rewrite prompts to be safe, specific, and privacy-friendly
* T21.G4.02: Evaluate AI media quality using a structured rubric

**ID:** T21.G6.03a
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Generate multiple images from a list of prompts
**Description:** Students write a program that reads 5 prompts from a list variable and generates an AI image for each using `OpenAI DALL-E: generate costume image` inside a counted repeat loop. They use `join` blocks to create unique costume names (e.g., "image1", "image2", etc.) and wait between generations. This intermediate skill bridges the gap between single-image generation (G5.03) and the full test bench (G6.03b), teaching programmatic iteration over AI generation without the complexity of UI design.

**Dependencies:**
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T10.G3.03: Create and update a list
* T21.G5.03: Generate a custom AI image with DALL-E using structured prompts

### T21.G6.05
**ID:** T21.G6.05
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Capture voice input with speech recognition (single provider)
**Description:** Students use the Microsoft Azure speech recognition blocks: `start recognizing speech in [LANGUAGE] record as [SOUNDNAME]`, `end speech recognition`, and `text from speech` to build a voice input application. They create a program that: (1) Displays "listening" indicator when recording starts, (2) Captures 5-10 seconds of speech, (3) Ends recognition and retrieves text, (4) Displays recognized text on screen, (5) Optionally saves the recorded audio using the SOUNDNAME parameter. Students test with 3 different languages and verify transcription accuracy. This skill focuses on Microsoft Azure (the more full-featured provider) rather than mentioning both Azure and OpenAI Whisper, simplifying the learning target.

**Dependencies:**
* T06.G4.01: Use broadcast to coordinate sprite actions
* T09.G4.01: Use ask/answer for user text input
* T21.G5.05: Test factors affecting speech-to-text accuracy

### T21.G6.06
**ID:** T21.G6.06
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Implement text content moderation with conditional logic
**Description:** Students use the `get moderation result for [TEXT]` reporter block to build an input validation system. The block returns "Pass" or "Fail". Students create a program that: (1) Uses `ask` block to get user text input, (2) Calls moderation block with the answer, (3) Uses `if/else` to handle results (if Pass: display text or proceed; if Fail: show "Content not appropriate" message and ask again), (4) Implements retry logic (allow 3 attempts before locking input). Students test with 5 test cases: appropriate text, mild inappropriate words, severe violations, edge cases (numbers, symbols). They document what kinds of content trigger "Fail" results.

**Dependencies:**
* T08.G4.01: Add else to handle the opposite case
* T09.G4.01: Use ask/answer for user text input
* T21.G5.06: Explain content moderation necessity with examples

## GRADE 7 (6 skills - REVISED)

### T21.G7.01
**ID:** T21.G7.01
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Build prompt template system with table-driven generation
**Description:** Students create a reusable prompt template library using CreatiCode tables. They design a table with 6 columns: subject, color_palette, camera_angle, lighting, mood, style_keywords. Each row represents one template preset (e.g., Row 1: "fantasy landscape", "purple and gold", "wide aerial", "dramatic sunset", "mysterious", "oil painting style"). A script reads each row with a loop, assembles the full prompt by joining column values (e.g., "fantasy landscape with purple and gold colors, wide aerial view, dramatic sunset lighting, mysterious mood, oil painting style"), calls `OpenAI DALL-E: generate costume image`, and records the costume name back in a 7th column. Students create 5 template rows and generate all 5 images programmatically, ensuring consistent art direction across a level or comic chapter.

**Dependencies:**
* T07.G5.01: Use counted loop with variable
* T10.G5.03: Add and remove items from a list

They: (1) Create test prompts with neutral role descriptions ("a scientist giving a talk", "a nurse helping a patient", "a construction worker", "a teacher with students", "a CEO in an office"), (2) Generate 10 variations of each prompt (50 total images), (3) Log characteristics in a table with columns: prompt, generation_number, perceived_gender, perceived_age, perceived_culture, perceived_ability, notes, (4) Analyze distributions using table data (e.g., "scientist" prompt: 80% male-presenting, 90% light-skinned, 100% able-bodied), (5) Identify bias gaps, (6) Revise prompts to request diversity explicitly (e.g., "a woman scientist from Southeast Asia giving a talk"), (7) Regenerate and compare before/after distributions. Students write a 1-page bias report with data tables, graphs, and recommendations. This highlights AI4K12's Ethical AI Design and Societal Impacts standards.

### T21.G7.04
**ID:** T21.G7.04
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Create hybrid animation combining AI generation and manual editing
**Description:** Students produce a 6-8 frame character animation blending AI generation with manual touch-ups: (1) Generate 6-8 character poses using DALL-E with consistent prompts (same character description + varying action: "standing", "walking step 1", "walking step 2", "jumping", etc.), (2) Import all frames as costumes, (3) Use costume editor to fix common AI artifacts (extra fingers, inconsistent proportions, blurry faces, mismatched edges), (4) Align all frames with equal dimensions and anchor points using costume editor tools, (5) Script timed animation using `switch costume to` and `wait` blocks, matching frame timing to UI state changes (button presses, score updates, health bar changes). Students document which AI-generated artifacts they fixed and how manual editing improved animation quality. This integrates T16 (UI) concepts.

**Dependencies:**
* T06.G5.01: Fix a behavior that runs at the wrong time
* T08.G5.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T10.G5.03: Add and remove items from a list

### T21.G7.05
**ID:** T21.G7.05
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Synchronize AI visuals with AI narration in a single scene
**Description:** Students create one immersive scene combining three AI modalities: (1) Start with a lore snippet (2-3 sentences), (2) Optionally enhance with ChatGPT to craft polished narration (or use original text), (3) Generate matching background using DALL-E with prompt derived from the lore, (4) Convert narration to speech using `say [TEXT] in [LANGUAGE] as [VOICETYPE]` text-to-speech block, (5) Script timing so voiceover starts when visual appears and describes what's on screen (use `when backdrop switches to [backdrop]` event, then `say` block with stored narration text). Students focus on cross-modal alignment: ensuring audio references match visual elements, timing audio length to scene duration, and creating cohesive sensory experience. This single-scene exercise prepares for G8.03's multi-scene capstone.

**Dependencies:**
* T06.G5.01: Fix a behavior that runs at the wrong time
* T10.G5.03: Add and remove items from a list
* T21.G5.04: Use AI text-to-speech with parameter customization
* T21.G6.04: Debug and iterate failed AI generations systematically

### T21.G7.06
**ID:** T21.G7.06
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Build live dictation system with continuous speech recognition
**Description:** Students use continuous speech recognition blocks (Microsoft Azure only, OpenAI Whisper doesn't support continuous mode): `start continuous speech recognition in [LANGUAGE] into list [LISTNAME]` and `stop continuous speech recognition`. They build a live dictation application that: (1) Starts continuous recognition when "Record" button is clicked, (2) Displays recognized text in real-time by reading the last item from the list (which updates continuously as speech is recognized), (3) Shows each completed sentence as a new paragraph, (4) Stops recording when "Stop" button is clicked, (5) Exports final text to a variable or saves to a table. Students test with 3 scenarios: short commands, medium dictation (1-2 minutes), long dictation (3-5 minutes), and compare accuracy. This enables voice-command applications and hands-free text input.

**Dependencies:**
* T10.G5.03: Add and remove items from a list
* T21.G6.05: Capture voice input with speech recognition (single provider)

## GRADE 8 (5 skills - REVISED)

### T21.G8.01
**ID:** T21.G8.01
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Build production generative art widget with moderation and guardrails
**Description:** Students design a user-facing generative art feature with full safety and quality controls: (1) Create in-app UI panel (text input field, 4-6 preset style buttons, preview display box, save button), (2) When user enters prompt, apply `get moderation result for [TEXT]` before generation, (3) If moderation passes: combine user input with selected preset style, generate with DALL-E, display in preview box, (4) If moderation fails: show friendly error message ("Let's try a different idea!"), don't generate, ask again, (5) Apply house style constraints (always append " in [style]" to maintain brand consistency), (6) Provide fallback curated art library if generation fails or takes too long, (7) Allow users to save approved images to personal gallery. Students test with 10 user inputs including edge cases (inappropriate, vague, conflicting, excellent) and document the user experience flow.

**Dependencies:**

### T21.G8.02
**ID:** T21.G8.02
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Implement approval pipeline dashboard for AI asset management
**Description:** Students build a professional asset management system that mirrors real studio workflows: (1) Create dashboard table with 7 columns: asset_id, asset_name, prompt, author, moderation_result (Pass/Fail), reviewer_notes (text), publish_status (Approved/Pending/Rejected), generation_timestamp, (2) Populate table with 10+ AI-generated assets (images or sounds), (3) Build review interface: display each asset with its metadata, provide "Approve" and "Reject" buttons, text input for reviewer notes, (4) Implement publish logic: only assets with publish_status = "Approved" become visible in the live scene (use conditional to check status before displaying), (5) Add filtering: show only Pending assets, only Approved, or only Rejected, (6) Generate approval report: count assets by status, identify oldest pending items, calculate approval rate. This teaches accountability, documentation, and governance of AI-generated content.

**Dependencies:**
* T08.G6.01: Use conditionals to control simulation steps
* T09.G6.01: Use variables to control animation timing

### T21.G8.03
**ID:** T21.G8.03
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Produce multi-scene narrative experience with navigation and transitions
**Description:** Students create a complete interactive story or presentation from a creative brief with 3-5 emotional beats (setup, conflict, climax, resolution): (1) Use ChatGPT to generate scene-by-scene descriptions (one prompt per scene with context), (2) Generate DALL-E art for each scene matching descriptions, (3) Create text-to-speech narration for each scene (varying voice parameters to match mood), (4) Build navigation UI (Next/Previous buttons, scene indicator, optional scene selector), (5) Implement smooth transitions between scenes (fade out/in, slide, or custom animation), (6) Ensure style consistency across all scenes (reuse prompt templates from G7.01), (7) Add interactivity (clickable elements in scenes, branching choices, sound effects triggers). Unlike G7.05's single-scene focus, this capstone requires managing multiple scenes with state tracking, consistent visual style, navigation logic, and coordinated transitions. Final product: 3-5 scene experience with full audio-visual-interactive integration.

### T21.G8.04
**ID:** T21.G8.04
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Develop comprehensive ethical guidelines document for AI media studio
**Description:** Students research a real-world case study (game studio using AI concept art, news outlet using AI images, education platform using AI voices, social media platform moderating AI content) and develop a 5-section ethical policy: (1) Disclosure requirements (when and how to inform users that content is AI-generated, labeling standards, transparency obligations), (2) Credit attribution (how to credit AI tools, data sources, human artists who created training data, original creators of remixed content), (3) Data sourcing ethics (ensuring training data was ethically obtained, avoiding copyrighted material, respecting cultural content, data privacy), (4) Review process (who reviews AI content, approval criteria, escalation paths for questionable content, frequency of reviews), (5) Accountability mechanisms (logging all generations, audit trails, incident response procedures). Students connect guidelines to their in-class workflows (G8.02 approval pipeline, G6.06-G6.07 moderation logs) to demonstrate practical implementation. Final deliverable: 3-4 page policy document with real case study analysis, stakeholder concerns (artists, users, communities, platform owners), and 8-10 specific policy recommendations.

### T21.G8.05
**ID:** T21.G8.05
**Topic:** T21 – AI Media
**Skill:** Create voice-controlled creative assistant integrating all AI media modalities
**Description:** Students build a comprehensive voice-controlled application that integrates all T21 AI media threads: (1) Use `start continuous speech recognition` to accept voice commands, (2) Parse recognized text to identify intent keywords ("draw", "create", "generate", "show me"), (3) Extract subject from command (e.g., "draw a sunset over mountains" → subject = "sunset over mountains"), (4) Apply text moderation to extracted subject before generation, (5) If approved: generate AI image with DALL-E using extracted subject, (6) Display generated image, (7) Announce result using text-to-speech ("I've created your sunset image!"), (8) Handle errors gracefully with voice feedback ("I didn't understand that" or "That request isn't appropriate"), (9) Support multi-turn conversation (accept refinements like "make it more colorful" or "try again"), (10) Log all interactions in table for review. This capstone integrates: speech recognition (G7.06), image generation (G5.03+), content moderation (G6.06-G6.07), text-to-speech (G5.04), and conditional logic (T08).
