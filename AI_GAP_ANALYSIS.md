## Critical Gaps (No Current Coverage)

### Gap 1: The Human Role in Creating AI ★★★ (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**AI4K12 Category:** 1. Humans and AI  
**AI4K12 Priority Level:** ★ Highest  
**Current Coverage:** ✗ None

**Learning Outcomes:**

**K-2:**
> Understand that AI is a tool created by humans to make decisions or to generate something (e.g., an image).

**Grades 3-5:**
> Describe the role of humans in the creation of AI.

**Grades 6-8:**
> Describe the roles that humans play (including in data curation and labeling) in creating and refining AI models.

**Why This is Critical:**
- Students use AI tools in T21-T24 but may not understand the human foundation
- Understanding human roles prevents anthropomorphization of AI
- Essential for "AI literacy" - knowing AI doesn't create itself
- Connects to career awareness (T36) and ethical considerations

**Impact on Learning:**
Without this understanding, students may:
- View AI as autonomous or magical
- Not recognize human biases embedded in AI systems
- Miss career pathways in AI development
- Fail to appreciate human responsibility for AI outcomes

**Recommended Skills to Add:**
1. **K-2:** Picture-based sorting: "Who made the AI?" (engineers, data collectors, testers)
2. **Grade 3:** Identify roles in creating a simple AI (designer, data collector, trainer, tester)
3. **Grade 4:** Learn what data labeling is and why it's important
4. **Grade 5:** Understand the full process from idea to trained AI model
5. **Grade 6:** Explore data curation and why data quality matters
6. **Grade 7:** Understand data labeling jobs and their impact on model quality
7. **Grade 8:** Design a plan for building an AI model including all human roles

**Suggested Topics:** Could be integrated into T21, T22, or T35

### Gap 2: Creating a Representation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**AI4K12 Category:** 2. Representation and Reasoning  
**AI4K12 Priority Level:** Medium  
**Current Coverage:** ✗ None

**Learning Outcomes:**

**K-2:**
> Create a representation of a physical object (e.g., line art drawing).

**Grades 3-5:**
> Create an abstract representation of a physical system that can be used to solve a problem (e.g., a map).

**Grades 6-8:**
> Create and evaluate different abstract representations (e.g., subway map).

**Why This Matters:**
- Foundational to understanding how AI "sees" the world
- Connects to data representation in ML
- Develops abstraction thinking (core CS skill)
- Prepares students to understand feature extraction

**Impact on Learning:**
Without this understanding, students may not grasp:
- Why AI needs data in specific formats
- How abstraction affects AI performance
- The choices humans make in representing data for AI

**Recommended Skills to Add:**
1. **K-2:** Draw simple pictures to represent objects (how to show a dog? A house?)
2. **Grade 3:** Create a map to help someone navigate (choose what details matter)
3. **Grade 4:** Represent a daily routine as pictures, flowchart, or schedule
4. **Grade 5:** Create different representations of the same data and compare usefulness
5. **Grade 6:** Design a visual representation for a complex system (like a subway map)
6. **Grade 7:** Evaluate tradeoffs between different data representations
7. **Grade 8:** Create feature vectors for an AI classification task

**Suggested Topics:** Could be integrated into T22 or T23, or added to T02 (Representing/Tracing)

---

### Gap 3: Ethical Creation of AI Systems ★★★ (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**AI4K12 Category:** 4. Ethical AI System Design and Programming  
**AI4K12 Priority Level:** ★ Highest  
**Current Coverage:** ✗ None (evaluation yes, creation no)

**Learning Outcomes:**

**K-2:**
> N/A

**Grades 3-5:**
> Describe an AI design process that considers the impact on end users and others who are impacted by the AI system.

**Grades 6-8:**
> Create a program using available AI tools, AI plugins, APIs, and/or AI models, with the following ethical considerations for the model's end users as well as others who are impacted by the model: fairness, bias, and accuracy, and then create a model card.

**Why This is Critical:**
- Bridges evaluation (which exists) to creation (which is missing)
- Model cards are industry best practice for AI transparency
- Students need to BE creators, not just critics
- Connects ethical thinking to actual design decisions

**Current Skills Address Evaluation But Not Creation:**
- T21.G4.03: "Evaluate an AI image for bias or appropriateness" ✓
- T21.G4.04: "Write clear, unbiased prompts for AI" ✓ (partial)
- But no skills for: Building an AI system with ethical documentation

**Impact on Learning:**
Without hands-on ethical creation, students:
- Remain passive consumers of AI ethics
- Don't learn to operationalize ethical principles
- Miss the complexity of balancing competing ethical concerns
- Don't develop skills for responsible AI innovation

**Recommended Skills to Add:**
1. **Grade 3:** Design a simple AI helper and describe who it helps and who it might not help
2. **Grade 4:** Plan an AI project and list questions to ask about fairness before building
3. **Grade 5:** Create a chatbot personality and explain design choices considering different users
4. **Grade 6:** Build an AI image classifier and test it for bias with diverse examples
5. **Grade 7:** Create an AI model and document its limitations in a simple model card
6. **Grade 8:** Develop an AI application using APIs with complete ethical documentation (full model card)

**Suggested Topics:** Best fit is **T24 (XO & AI-Supported Coding)** or could create new topic

**Current Coverage:**
- T22 has excellent reasoning coverage for 3-8
- No K-2 skills on binary decision-making

**Why K-2 Coverage Matters:**
- Binary thinking is foundational to computational thinking
- Accessible to youngest learners through games and physical activities
