================================================================================
PROGRESSION FLOW:
================================================================================

KINDERGARTEN FOUNDATION:
  GK.01: Identify parts (no dependencies) → Foundation skill
  GK.02: Match parts to whole objects → depends on GK.01
  GK.03: Order pictures to show steps → depends on T01.GK.01
  GK.04: Choose missing middle step → depends on GK.03
  GK.05: Describe what each step accomplishes → depends on GK.03

GRADE 1-2 BUILDING BLOCKS:
  G1 skills build on GK foundation (parts and steps)
  G2 skills introduce subtasks and grouping concepts

GRADE 3 PIVOT (Implementation Context Introduced):
  G3 skills integrate with practical coding (T06, T07, T08, T09)
  Features, prioritization, and planning concepts introduced

GRADE 4-5 COMPONENT THINKING:
  G4 introduces components, modules, team organization
  G5 develops comprehensive breakdowns and dependency analysis

GRADE 6-8 ADVANCED ARCHITECTURE:
  G6 focuses on modules, reusability, and milestones
  G7 introduces architecture diagrams and decomposition evaluation
  G8 covers formal specifications and refactoring

================================================================================
X-2 RULE COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION:
================================================================================

Grade 3+ Skills (37 skills checked):
  ✓ No Kindergarten dependencies found
  ✓ All dependencies are Grade 1 or higher

Grade 4+ Skills (30 skills checked):
  ✓ No Grade 1 dependencies found
  ✓ All dependencies are Grade 2 or higher

Grade 5+ Skills (23 skills checked):

================================================================================
SKILLS WITH NO DEPENDENCIES (1):
================================================================================

T03.GK.01: Identify parts that make up a whole
  - This is the foundational skill for the entire T03 topic

================================================================================
SKILLS WITH MOST DEPENDENCIES (Multiple Dependencies):
================================================================================

Skills with 4 dependencies:
