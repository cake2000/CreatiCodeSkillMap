Skill: Explore simple cipher techniques with alphabet position lookup
Description: Students use CreatiCode blocks to shift letters using alphabet position. They create a simple encoder that: (1) Sets an alphabet string variable to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", (2) For each letter in the message, finds its position in the alphabet using string operations, (3) Adds the shift value to the position (mod 26 for wrapping), (4) Extracts the shifted letter using substring blocks, (5) Joins results to create encoded output. They test with shift=3 and decode by reversing the shift. This prepares them for grade 7 full cipher implementation.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.01: Concatenate strings to build messages
* T32.G5.10: Practice encryption through Caesar cipher (unplugged)

ID: T32.G7.01
Topic: T32 – Cybersecurity & Digital Safety
Skill: Implement Caesar cipher using alphabet position lookup
Description: Students build on G6 cipher exploration to implement a full Caesar cipher in CreatiCode. Using string manipulation and list blocks (NOT character code conversion which CreatiCode doesn't support), they create a script that: (1) Creates alphabet lookup ("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"), (2) Takes message and shift value as input, (3) Uses `substring of [TEXT] from position (P) to position (P)` to process each character, (4) Finds character position in alphabet, applies shift with modulo wrapping, (5) Joins results using `join [T1] [T2] ... with []` blocks. They test encryption/decryption, and discuss why simple ciphers are vulnerable to frequency analysis and why modern encryption uses stronger algorithms.

* T09.G5.01: Use multiple variables together in a single expression
* T10.G5.01: Extract substrings and manipulate text

Skill: Simulate password cracking attempts
Description: Students build or use a cracking speed calculator in CreatiCode to compute how long it takes to crack passwords of different lengths (4-character vs 8-character vs 12-character) at various speeds (1000 guesses/second, 1 million guesses/second). They calculate total possible combinations (26^length for lowercase only, 62^length for alphanumeric) and time to crack.

Skill: Analyze social media privacy and data collection practices
Description: Students investigate how social media platforms collect and use data: tracking user behavior, building profiles for targeted advertising, sharing data with third parties, and using AI to recommend content. They read real privacy policies (simplified excerpts), examine data export files (demo examples), and discuss the tradeoff between free services and personal data. They create privacy-protective strategies (limiting shared information, reviewing privacy settings, understanding data policies).
