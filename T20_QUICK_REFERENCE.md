## GAP ANALYSIS SUMMARY

### Only Identified Gap: Extrusion (Minor)

**Current State:**
- Extrusion mentioned in G7.05.03 description ("extruded shapes")
- Not explicitly taught as standalone concept

**Impact:** LOW
- Students can infer from vertex manipulation
- Not critical for K-8 level

**Recommendation:**
Add optional skill:
```
T20.G6.05.04: Create extruded 3D shapes from 2D paths
- Grade: 6
- Dependencies: T20.G6.05.02 (3D curves)
- Description: Create 2D outlines, extrude to 3D volumes
```
