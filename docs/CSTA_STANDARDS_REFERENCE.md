## CreatiCode Topic to CSTA Topic Area Mapping

This mapping helps identify which CSTA standards apply to each CreatiCode topic:

| CreatiCode Domain | CreatiCode Topics | Primary CSTA Topic Area | Secondary CSTA Areas |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| D1: Algorithms & Design | T01-T05 | ALG (Algorithms and Design) | PRO (for implementation) |
| D2: Programming Core | T06-T13 | PRO (Programming) | ALG (for algorithm design) |
| D3: Applications & AI | T14-T24 | PRO, DAA (for AI/data) | CAS (for AI ethics/society) |
| D4: Data & Analysis | T25-T29 | DAA (Data and Analysis) | PRO (for data processing code) |
| D5: Systems & Society | T30-T36 | SAS, CAS | All (cross-cutting) |
