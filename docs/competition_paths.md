## Notes

- Skills are identified by their topic and grade (e.g., T07.G4.02 = Topic 7, Grade 4, Skill 2)
- Recommended skills are minimum starting points; students may benefit from deeper exploration
- Multiple topics can be studied simultaneously for older students
- Competition-specific practice projects should reinforce these skills
