# SYNTHESIS SKILLS: Technical + Ethical Integration

This analysis identifies "synthesis skills" that bring together technical understanding with social/ethical dimensions.

## High-Impact Synthesis Skills

### T30-T33: Hardware/Software → Platforms (Technology Synthesis)

**T30.G8.* - Hardware/Software Synthesis**
- Combines understanding of devices, programs, and interaction
- Foundation for modern computing literacy
- Dependencies: Progressive through T30 grades

**T33.G8.* - Platform/API Synthesis**
- Understanding external services and APIs
- Ethical use of platforms (T36 connection)
- AI integration (T21-T24 connection)

### T34-T35-T36: Historical → Impact → Ethics (Values Synthesis)

**T34.G8.* - Computing History as Context**
- Not memorization, but understanding evolution
- Connects to current technology decisions
- Links to T35 impacts

**T35.G8.01 - Impact Synthesis**
- Understanding consequences across domains
- Connecting game impacts (T14)
- AI impacts (T21-T24)
- Data impacts (T25-T29)
- Strong prerequisite for T36.G8.01

**T36.G8.01 - Responsible Computing Capstone**
- Integration of all ethics, collaboration, careers
- Synthesis of security (T32), impacts (T35), design (T05)
- Professional responsibility across all computing contexts

### T31-T33: Infrastructure (Systems Synthesis)

**T31.G8.* - Network/Cloud Systems**
- Internet infrastructure understanding
- Connection to T19 multiplayer systems
- Privacy implications (T32 connection)

**T33.G7-T33.G8 - API & AI Services**
- Understanding external AI services (T22-T23)
- Ethical concerns with external dependencies
- Security implications (T32)

## Synthesis Skill Patterns

### Pattern 1: Conceptual Understanding → Application
- T30 (what hardware/software is) → T33 (how to use APIs)
- T31 (internet concepts) → T33 (cloud services)
- T34 (computing history) → T35 (modern impacts)

### Pattern 2: Individual → Societal Scope
- T32.G1-2 (personal security) → T32.G7-8 (system security)
- T35.G1-2 (personal impacts) → T35.G7-8 (systemic impacts)
- T36.G1-2 (personal careers) → T36.G7-8 (professional ethics)

### Pattern 3: Technical Details → Ethical Implications
- T30 technical details → T35 design implications
- T32 security mechanisms → T36 ethical hacking/security practices
- T33 API capabilities → T35 AI ethics (when APIs are AI services)

## Critical Synthesis Moments (Grade 7-8)

### T35.G7.01 - Recognizing Bias in Systems
- Connects probability/statistics (T27/T28)
- Ethical implications (T36 prerequisite)
- AI context (T21/T22/T24)
- Data representation (T25/T29)

**Cross-domain dependencies**: T28.G7.03, T25.G8.02, T27.G7.02, T35.G7.01

### T36.G8.01 - Responsible Computing Integration
- Prerequisite for entire T36.G8.* capstone sequence
- Integrates: T32 (security), T35 (impacts), T05 (HCD), T21-T24 (AI ethics)
- Requires understanding from T06-T13 (programming), T14-T24 (applications)

**True integration skill**: Understands technical possibilities AND ethical obligations

## Recommendation: Highlight Synthesis Skills in Curriculum

These skills should be explicitly marked as "synthesis" skills because they:
1. Integrate multiple prior domains
2. Bridge technical and humanistic understanding  
3. Prepare for advanced CS study and careers
4. Develop computational citizenship

### Suggested Implementation:
- Explicit "integration projects" at G7-G8
- Cross-curricular connections (ethics, history, sociology)
- Case studies combining technical and social analysis
- Guest perspectives from industry and policy
