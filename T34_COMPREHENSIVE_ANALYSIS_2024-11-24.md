2. **Fix Dependency Violations**
   ```
   T34.G5.02: Change T34.G3.01 → T34.G4.01
   T34.G5.03: Change T34.G2.03 → T34.G4.02
   T34.G6.02: Remove T34.G4.02 (keep T34.G5.01)
   T34.G6.03: Remove T34.G4.01 (keep T34.G5.01)
   ```

3. **Address Content Complexity**
   - **T34.G4.03:** Either simplify significantly or move to Grade 6
   - **T34.G2.02:** Consider simplifying language or moving to Grade 3

### OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS
