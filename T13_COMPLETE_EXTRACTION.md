## KINDERGARTEN (Grade K) - 3 Skills

### T13.GK.01
**Skill**: Spot a missing or wrong action in an animation
**Description**: Students watch a short picture story or animation and compare what happens to what was supposed to happen (e.g., the character should jump but doesn't, or moves the wrong direction). They simply point to or circle the moment something went wrong without explaining why or fixing it.
**Dependencies**: None
**Grade**: K

### T13.GK.02
**Skill**: Retry after noticing something went wrong
**Description**: Students follow a simple set of picture steps for a task (e.g., stacking blocks, moving a character on a board), notice when the result is not what was intended, and try the steps again from the beginning. They experience the "try, check, retry" cycle without changing the steps themselves.
**Dependencies**:
- T13.GK.01: Spot a missing or wrong action
**Grade**: K

### T13.GK.03
**Skill**: Fix a single wrong direction or action in steps
**Description**: Students "play computer" by acting out or watching a character follow a short list of picture steps to reach a fun goal (like a treasure or door). When the character ends up in the wrong place or does something silly, they identify which one movement is wrong (e.g., an arrow pointing left instead of right, or "sit down" too early) and swap it for a better step so the routine works.
**Dependencies**:
- T01.GK.03: Find the first and last pictures
- T13.GK.01: Spot a missing or wrong action
**Grade**: K

**Dependencies**:
- T01.GK.03: Find the first and last pictures
**Grade**: 1

### T13.G1.02
**Skill**: Fix a sequence error in steps

**Dependencies**:
- T01.GK.02: Put pictures in order for coming to class
**Grade**: 1

### T13.G1.03
**Skill**: Change a number to fix a repeated action
**Description**: Students modify a number in picture‑based instructions (e.g., change "jump 10 times" to "jump 3 times" so the movement matches a picture, or change a count of claps) to correct unexpected behavior in a routine.
**Dependencies**:
- T04.GK.02: Extend a repeating pattern by one tile
**Grade**: 1

### T13.G1.04
**Skill**: Demonstrate steps physically and identify the error
**Description**: Students act out a set of picture steps (e.g., pretend to follow a recipe, walk through a maze path) and identify where something goes wrong. They explain the error verbally or by pointing (e.g., "We forgot to open the paint before painting" or "I went left instead of right here").

## ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. CRITICAL: Dependency on Non-Existent Skill
**T13.G5.05** has dependency on:
- T13.G4.07: Debug a loop containing a conditional (two-level nesting)

But the actual skill ID is **T13.G4.07: Debug complex two-level nested structures**
The title in the dependency doesn't match the actual skill title.

### 2. Grade 3 Anomaly: Variant Skill ID
**T13.G3.01b** - The use of "b" suffix is unusual in the naming scheme. Most variants use decimal notation (e.g., T13.G4.05.01, T13.G4.05.02). This inconsistency could cause confusion.

### 3. Dependency Chain Issues

#### Issue 3a: G7 skills depend on T08.G5.01 which doesn't exist in the standard progression
**T13.G7.01, T13.G7.02, T13.G7.03, T13.G7.04, T13.G7.05** all depend on:
- T08.G5.01: Use a simple if in a script

This appears to be the same as T08.G3.01 but at a higher grade level. Need to verify if T08.G5.01 actually exists.

### 4. Kindergarten Progression Looks Good
K-2 grades show appropriate unplugged/physical activities:
- K: Spotting errors in animations, retrying, fixing simple steps
- G1: Explaining problems, reordering steps, changing numbers, physical demonstration
- G2: Tracing and predicting, fixing signals and repeats

This is well-designed for early learners.

### 5. Grade 3 Transition to Block Coding is Appropriate
All Grade 3 skills properly introduce CreatiCode block-based programming:
- All depend on T06.G3.01 (building 3-5 block scripts)
- Focus on simple debugging tasks
- Mental tracing before execution

### 6. Grade 4 Heavy Load
**9 skills** in Grade 4 is significantly more than other grades. This might be too much for a single grade level. Consider:
- Breaking some skills into Grade 3 or 5
- The testing methodology (T13.G4.05.01, T13.G4.05.02) could potentially be split across grades

### 7. Testing Skills Show Good Progression
- G4: Simple test plans (05.01), running tests (05.02)
- G5: Comprehensive test plans (03)
- G6: Systematic boundary tests (03)
- G7: Comprehensive test cases for algorithms (01)
- G8: Rigorous test suites (01)

This shows clear scaffolding.

### 8. Debugging Complexity Progression is Well-Structured
- G3: Simple scripts (01, 02, 03)
- G4: Conditionals in loops (01), two-level nesting (07)
- G5: Three+ levels of nesting (05)
- G6: Multiple variables (01)
- G7: Logic errors (02)
- G8: Against specifications (02)

### 9. Missing Skill: Error Messages and User Feedback
While T13.G8.03 mentions "user-friendly error messages," there's no earlier skill that teaches students to understand or interpret error messages from the system itself. This could be added around Grade 5-6.

### 10. Good Integration of Defensive Programming
- G5: Input validation (02)
- G7: Anticipate runtime errors (05)
- G8: Comprehensive error handling (03)

This builds well over time.

### 11. Documentation Skills Progress Well
- G4: Record what went wrong (08)
- G6: Document limitations (04)
- G7: Refactor for clarity (03)
- G8: Evaluate code quality (04)

### 12. Potential Gap: Debugging with Peers/Pair Debugging
No skills explicitly address collaborative debugging or code review from a debugging perspective. This could be valuable in upper grades.

### 13. T13.G4.05.01 and T13.G4.05.02 Numbering
These use the decimal sub-numbering system (05.01, 05.02), which is good for showing progression within a concept, but it's only used here and not consistently elsewhere in T13.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority
1. **Fix the dependency mismatch in T13.G5.05** - Update to match actual skill title
2. **Verify T08.G5.01 exists** - Multiple G7 skills depend on this
3. **Rename T13.G3.01b to T13.G3.01.02** for consistency with decimal notation

### Medium Priority
4. **Consider redistributing G4 skills** - 9 skills may be too many for one grade
5. **Add error message interpretation skill** around G5-G6
6. **Add collaborative debugging skill** around G6-G7

### Low Priority
7. **Consider more consistent use of decimal sub-numbering** for related skills (like testing skills, debugging nested structures, etc.)
