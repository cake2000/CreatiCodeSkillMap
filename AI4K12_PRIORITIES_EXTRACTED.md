## Implementation Considerations

### From AI4K12 Report

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Begin in Early Elementary School** - Many aspects of AI don't require advanced mathematics and can be taught through hands-on experiences from K-2.

2. **Use Supportive Tools** - More tools need to be developed to make complex topics accessible without requiring programming.

3. **Prepare Students as Critical Consumers, Responsible Creators, and Informed Citizens** - Not just for AI specialists, but for all students regardless of career path.

**Important Notes:**

- Standards should be broad and general to permit implementation in various contexts
- Rapid technological changes require flexible approaches
- Examples and scaffolding are crucial for teachers new to AI education
- Avoid anthropomorphizing AI (e.g., careful use of "learn")
- Consider LLM age restrictions (typically 13+) when designing elementary activities
