# T01 – Everyday Algorithms & Step‑by‑Step Thinking: K–8 Skill List (v3, IXL‑Style Granularity)

Topic reference: `T01 Everyday Algorithms & Step‑by‑Step Thinking` in `domains_topics_overview.md`  
Domain: Algorithms & Design (D1) · Primary CSTA focus: ALG‑AF, with links to ALG‑PS, ALG‑IM, PRO‑PF, PRO‑TR

This v3 version refines T01 into **smaller, IXL‑style skills** with:

- More skills per grade (6–8 instead of ~4), each with a **single, narrow objective**.
- Gentle, **within‑grade progressions** (no big jumps) from concrete → abstract.
- Clear **strands** inside each grade (e.g., sequence basics, choices, repetition, comparison/debugging).
- Alignment with:
  - **CSTA Draft 2.0** (`docs/CSTA_STANDARDS_REFERENCE.md`)
  - **K–2 picture‑based guidelines** (`docs/K2_QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`)
  - CreatiCode’s block‑coding capabilities for Grades 3–8.

IDs follow the existing pattern `T01.G<grade>.<nn>`, but we expand beyond `.04` where needed. Existing high‑leverage skills (e.g., T01.G1.01) are preserved conceptually and surrounded with intermediate skills.

## Notes on Mapping from v2/Existing Skills

- This v3 spec **refines and expands** the v2 T01 skills:
  - Most v2 skills correspond to a **cluster** of v3 skills (e.g., v2 `T01.G4.02` → v3 `T01.G4.02` and `T01.G4.03`).
  - K–2 v3 skills are consistent with existing picture‑based implementations in `skills_k8_ai_complete_FINAL.json`, but split into smaller, more specific skills.
- For implementation:
  - Existing IDs like `T01.G1.01` and `T01.G3.01` are kept conceptually aligned, easing migration.
  - New IDs (e.g., `T01.G2.07`, `T01.G5.06`, `T01.G7.05`) will need to be added to the JSON and dependency graph, using this document as the blueprint.
- Dependencies:
  - Within each grade, v3 skills should be ordered as written (lower IDs are prerequisites for higher ones in the same strand).
  - Cross‑topic dependencies (e.g., to T06–T09) remain as in v2; new skills should reference the same core coding constructs where applicable.
