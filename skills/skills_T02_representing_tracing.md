## Grade K (PreK–K)

Representing and tracing algorithms at this level focuses on recognizing and describing simple step-by-step processes using pictures, stories, and everyday language.

### T02.GK.01 – Identify a sequence of pictures as an algorithm

- **Short name:** Recognize picture steps for a task
- **Description:** Students look at a series of picture cards showing steps in a simple process (e.g., getting dressed, brushing teeth, making a snack) and recognize that the sequence represents "a way to do something." They understand that an algorithm is a set of steps that are ordered and repeated the same way each time.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice with image sequence. Show 2–3 sets of 4–5 picture sequences; one set correctly shows a familiar process in order. Students identify which sequence "shows the right steps to do this." Auto‑grading checks selected sequence and order.
- **CSTA:** EK‑ALG‑AF‑01 (Identify algorithms in daily activities).

### T02.GK.02 – Put steps in the right order (story pictures)

- **Short name:** Order steps in a picture story
- **Description:** Given a scrambled set of picture cards representing a simple process, students arrange them in the correct order. This develops understanding that algorithms have a sequence and that order matters.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, sequencing. Show a set of 3–4 jumbled pictures (e.g., steps to plant a flower); students drag them into the correct order. Auto‑grading checks the final sequence against a reference.
- **CSTA:** EK‑ALG‑AF‑01.

### T02.GK.03 – Tell a story about "first," "next," "last"

- **Short name:** Describe sequence with order words
- **Description:** Students use directional and sequence language ("first," "next," "then," "last") to narrate or describe a simple process shown in pictures. This builds verbal fluency with sequence, a precursor to pseudocode and flowcharts.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, guided response. Show 3 picture steps; students select or say the sequence word that completes sentences like "First we ____, next we ____, last we ____." Auto‑grading checks vocabulary and logic.
- **CSTA:** EK‑ALG‑AF‑01.
