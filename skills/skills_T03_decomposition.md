## Grade K (PreK–K)

In Kindergarten, decomposition focuses on recognizing parts of familiar objects and simple tasks, with adult guidance to organize activities into steps.

### T03.GK.01 – Name the parts of an object or scene

- **Short name:** Identify parts that make up a whole
- **Description:** Students recognize and name individual parts of familiar objects (e.g., a car has doors, wheels, windshield) or scenes (e.g., a classroom has a door, windows, tables). This builds foundational understanding that complex things are made of simpler pieces.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice or picture labeling. Show a picture of an object or scene and ask students to identify or point to individual parts. Auto‑grading checks selected parts against a key.
- **CSTA:** EK‑ALG‑PS‑03 (Identify individual parts that make up a whole object).

### T03.GK.02 – Put story pictures in order

- **Short name:** Sequence a simple story with pictures
- **Description:** Students arrange 3–4 picture cards into the correct order to show a simple story (e.g., wake up, eat breakfast, go to school). This builds understanding that tasks have steps and a sequence.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, drag‑and‑drop or selection. CreatiCode displays picture cards that students reorder. Auto‑grading checks final order against the intended narrative.
- **CSTA:** EK‑ALG‑PS‑03, EK‑PRO‑PM‑05 (Articulate how one has completed a task or solved a problem that takes multiple steps).

### T03.GK.03 – List steps for a simple routine

- **Short name:** Tell the steps of a classroom routine
- **Description:** Students verbally describe or select from cards the individual steps of a familiar routine (e.g., washing hands: wet, soap, scrub, rinse, dry). They learn that familiar activities can be broken into smaller steps.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice or guided text input. Show a routine (e.g., "Getting ready for lunch") and ask students to select or arrange step cards. Auto‑grading uses a whitelist of acceptable orderings.
- **CSTA:** EK‑PRO‑PM‑05.
