## DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

- **Total dependencies:** 202
- **Within T19:** 132 (65%)
- **Cross-topic:** 70 (35%)

### Key Cross-Topic Dependencies:

**Most Common External Dependencies:**
1. **T01 (Sequencing)**: Foundation for ordering art steps and recipes
2. **T04 (Patterns)**: Core to pattern recognition in early grades
3. **T07 (Loops)**: Essential for all drawing and iteration work
4. **T09 (Variables)**: Critical for parametric and generative art
5. **T10 (Lists)**: Used for color palettes, data visualization
6. **T11 (Custom Blocks)**: Enables modular tile patterns and abstraction
7. **T06 (Events)**: Powers interactivity
8. **T08 (Conditionals)**: Drives branching designs

**Observation:** The dependency structure shows T19 as an *integration topic* that synthesizes multiple CS concepts rather than existing in isolation. This is pedagogically sound—art provides motivating context for abstract programming concepts.

## PATTERNS & OBSERVATIONS

### ✅ **Strengths:**

1. **Developmentally Appropriate Scaffolding**
   - K-2 unplugged → G3 coding transition is well-paced
   - Each grade builds meaningfully on the previous

2. **Multiple Learning Pathways**
   - Students can engage through visual art, math, data viz, or interactivity
   - Accommodates different learning styles

3. **Rich Upper Grades**
   - G7-8 content rivals professional creative coding courses
   - Includes cutting-edge topics (AI, procedural generation, body tracking)

4. **Integration with CS Fundamentals**
   - 35% cross-topic dependencies show art as *context* for CS, not isolated
   - Reinforces loops, variables, functions, debugging in motivating ways

5. **Explicit Skill Granularity**
   - Sub-skills break complex topics into achievable steps
   - No skill feels overwhelming

6. **Professional Practice Skills**
   - Portfolio curation (T19.G8.20)
   - Documentation (T19.G8.10.02)
   - Using AI tools (T19.G8.18)
   - Preparing students for real careers in creative tech

### ⚠️ **Potential Issues/Gaps:**

1. **No Skills Without Dependencies**
   - Every skill has at least one prerequisite
   - This is actually GOOD—shows careful sequencing
   - But means curriculum is highly linear; skipping grades would be difficult

2. **Heavy G7-8 Load**
   - 47 skills across 2 grades (37% of total curriculum)
   - Risk: Students who join late or have gaps will struggle
   - Mitigation: Strong foundations in K-6 should prepare students

3. **Limited Explicit Art History/Theory**
   - Only T19.G8.03 addresses artistic concepts (authorship)
   - Could benefit from more context about algorithmic art movements (Op Art, kinetic sculpture, etc.)
   - Suggestion: Add skills about studying historical algorithmic artists

4. **Platform Dependency**
   - Many skills explicitly reference CreatiCode-specific blocks
   - Positive: Students get deep expertise
   - Negative: May limit transfer to other platforms (Processing, p5.js)
   - Mitigation: Concepts are transferable even if syntax differs

5. **Accessibility Considerations**
   - Visual-heavy curriculum may challenge visually impaired students
   - G5.13 (video sensing) and G5.14 (sound reactive) offer some multimodal options
   - Could expand tactile/audio art options in early grades

6. **Assessment Challenges**
   - Art is subjective—how do you assess "successful" generative art?
   - T19.G5.12 (explain design choices) and T19.G8.03 (evaluate authorship) address this
   - More explicit rubrics for aesthetic evaluation might help

### 🔍 **Notable Pedagogical Decisions:**

1. **Pen vs Looks Distinction (G3)**
   - Explicit comparison prevents common beginner confusion
   - Shows thoughtful curriculum design

2. **3D Introduction in G5**
   - Well-timed: After 2D mastery but before advanced algorithms
   - Allows G6-8 to build sophisticated 3D work

3. **AI Integration Starts G6, Deepens G7-8**
   - Reflects modern creative practice
   - Students learn to use AI as tool, not replacement

4. **Generative Art as G7-8 Focus**
   - Aligns with contemporary art/design trends
   - Positions students at intersection of art and CS

5. **Body Tracking in G7**
   - Engages kinesthetic learners
   - Creates installation art opportunities

   - Study pioneers: Vera Molnár, Frieder Nake, Manfred Mohr
   - Contextualize what students are learning

4. **G7-8: Ethical AI in Art**
   - Expand T19.G8.03 to cover copyright, training data ethics
   - Critical thinking about AI-generated art

5. **All Grades: Gallery/Exhibition Skills**
   - Presenting work to audiences
