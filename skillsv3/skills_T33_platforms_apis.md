## Grade K (PreK–K)

At the K–1 level, students begin to recognize that computing tools and platforms help people do things, and they start to notice that some tools are used across different people and places. No code-based API understanding is expected; focus is on naming tools and their purposes.

### T33.GK.01 – Name a computing tool and what it does

- **Short name:** Identify computing tools and their purposes
- **Description:** Students recognize common computing tools they use in school or at home (e.g., tablets, apps, websites) and describe, in simple words, what each tool helps people do (e.g., "This app helps me draw," "The website lets me watch videos"). They begin understanding that tools are created by people and serve a purpose.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice or naming. Show pictures of familiar apps or tools (CreatiCode itself, YouTube, Google, etc.); students match each to a simple description of what it does. Auto‑grading checks the correct pairing.
- **CSTA:** EK‑SAS‑IM‑03, EK‑CAS‑ET‑02 (recognizing benefits of tools in daily life).

### T33.GK.02 – Describe how a tool helps and what it needs

- **Short name:** What does a tool need to work?
- **Description:** Students observe that tools need things to work (e.g., "the app needs Wi-Fi," "the computer needs to be plugged in") and that tools can help or sometimes cause problems. This builds awareness of tool dependencies and impact.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, guided discussion or multiple choice. Scenario: "A student wants to use a video app at home but it doesn't work. Which might be the problem?" (no internet, app not installed, etc.). Auto‑grading matches the chosen reason.
- **CSTA:** EK‑SAS‑IM‑03, EK‑CAS‑ET‑02.

## Grade 1

Grade 1 deepens awareness of tools and begins naming the idea that tools are provided by others (creators/companies) and that using tools involves benefits and risks.

### T33.G1.01 – Recognize that people and companies create tools

- **Short name:** Tools are created by people
- **Description:** Students understand that the apps, websites, and games they use were created by people or teams at companies, and that these creators decide what the tools can do and how they work. This is a pre‑API insight into the idea that tools come from external sources.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, picture or text matching. Show logos or names of familiar tools and ask "Who made this?" with choices like "A person," "A company," or "A school." Auto‑grading checks correct attribution.
- **CSTA:** E1‑CAS‑HC‑01, E1‑SAS‑IM‑03.

### T33.G1.02 – List benefits and harms of a tool

- **Short name:** Good and bad things about a tool
- **Description:** Students discuss or list both positive effects (e.g., "I can talk to friends") and negative effects (e.g., "I spend too much time on it") of a familiar tool they use. This introduces ethical thinking about technology dependencies.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, sorting or list completion. Given a tool (e.g., "a video app"), students sort statements into "helps people" and "can cause problems" categories. Auto‑grading counts correct sorts.
- **CSTA:** E1‑SAS‑IM‑03, E1‑CAS‑ET‑02.

### T33.G1.03 – Understand that online tools need internet

- **Short name:** Online tools need connection

## Grade 2

Grade 2 moves toward understanding that tools connect to other services or data. Students start naming "apps" and "websites" as distinct types of platforms, and explore what happens when tools connect to the internet.

### T33.G2.01 – Explain what an "app" or "website" is

- **Short name:** Understand apps and websites
- **Description:** Students learn that an "app" is software installed on a device that does specific things, while a "website" is accessed through the internet via a browser. They understand that both are tools created to help or entertain people.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice or classification. Given a list of tools (WhatsApp, Wikipedia, Candy Crush, Google Docs), students sort them as "app" or "website" (or recognize that some are both). Auto‑grading checks the sort.
- **CSTA:** E2‑SAS‑HW‑01, E2‑SAS‑IM‑03.

### T33.G2.02 – Describe what data a tool collects (introduce idea)

- **Short name:** Tools collect information about you

### T33.G3.01 – Recognize that CreatiCode is a platform

- **Short name:** What is the CreatiCode platform?
- **Description:** Students learn that CreatiCode is an online platform—a place where they can create, code, and share projects. The platform provides the tools (blocks, sprites, etc.) they use, and it connects to the internet to save their work and share with others.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, guided introduction. A short lesson explains CreatiCode's role: it runs in a web browser, saves work to the cloud, allows sharing, etc. A follow-up multiple-choice checks understanding. Auto‑grading verifies key concepts.
- **CSTA:** E3‑SAS‑IM‑04, SAS‑NW (understanding platform infrastructure).

### T33.G3.02 – Use AI text generation (ChatGPT block intro)

- **Short name:** Ask an AI for help with text
- **Description:** Students use a ChatGPT block in CreatiCode to send a text request to OpenAI's AI and get a response back into their project. For example, they might ask the AI "Tell me a joke" or "What is photosynthesis?" and display the answer in their project. This is their first direct use of an external API.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, guided exploration. Starter project includes a ChatGPT block and a sprite. Students are prompted: "Use the block to ask the AI a question. What does it say?" They modify the prompt and observe the response. Auto‑grading checks that a ChatGPT request block is present and that a response is captured.
- **CSTA:** E3‑CAS‑ET‑02, CAS‑ET (using emerging technology).

### T33.G3.03 – Understand that external services might not work

- **Short name:** What happens if the internet is down?
- **Description:** Students learn that CreatiCode projects that use AI, speech, or the internet might not work if the internet connection is lost or if the external service (like OpenAI or Google Translate) is temporarily down. This introduces the concept of service reliability and dependency.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, scenario-based. Present a scenario: "Your project uses an AI block to generate text. The next day, you try to run it and it doesn't work. What might have happened?" Choices include internet down, AI service down, wrong login, etc. Auto‑grading checks conceptual understanding.
- **CSTA:** E3‑SAS‑IM‑04, E3‑CAS‑ET‑02.

## Grade 4

Grade 4 students use more CreatiCode features that rely on external services, including voice input/output, image APIs, and cloud variables. They begin to understand data flow between their project and external services.

### T33.G4.01 – Use speech recognition (voice input)

- **Short name:** Record and transcribe speech
- **Description:** Students use CreatiCode's speech recognition blocks to record their voice and convert it to text within their project. They understand that the audio is sent to a speech-to-text service, which returns the recognized text that the project can then use.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, guided exploration. Starter project has speech recognition blocks and a sprite. Students add a start/stop button to record speech, observe the text result, and use it (e.g., to control a sprite or display in a variable). Auto‑grading checks that speech blocks are correctly placed and that text is captured.
- **CSTA:** E4‑CAS‑ET‑02, DAA‑DF (understanding data input from external source).

### T33.G4.02 – Use text‑to‑speech (voice output)

- **Short name:** Make a sprite speak with AI voice
- **Description:** Students use CreatiCode's AI Speaker block to convert text to spoken audio. They can choose languages and voice styles, and the system generates speech. They learn that a text‑to‑speech service processes their text and returns audio.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, starter project. A sprite should say a sentence. Students use an AI Speaker block instead of a regular "say" block, select a language and voice, and hear the audio. Auto‑grading verifies the block is present and working.
- **CSTA:** E4‑CAS‑ET‑02, PRO‑PF (using a new tool/block).

### T33.G4.03 – Search for AI-generated images

- **Challenge format:** Concept and practice, exploratory. Students are prompted to find a specific backdrop or sprite image using the AI image tool. They search using keywords, and if no suitable image exists, they generate one by writing a description (e.g., "a sunny beach with palm trees"). Auto‑grading verifies that an image was found/generated and added to the project.
- **CSTA:** E4‑CAS‑ET‑02, PRO‑PF.

### T33.G4.04 – Understand API key and authentication concept

- **Short name:** What is an API key?
- **Description:** Students learn, at a high level, that some external services (like ChatGPT or Google Translate) need a way to identify the user or project accessing them. They understand that an API key is like a password for tools—it proves that the person using the service has permission. CreatiCode handles this behind the scenes, but students should know it exists.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, explanation. A lesson explains that "API keys are like passwords for tools" and that CreatiCode keeps these keys safe so students' projects can use external services. A follow-up multiple-choice checks understanding. Auto‑grading verifies conceptual knowledge.
- **CSTA:** E4‑SAS‑IM‑04, E4‑CAS‑ET‑02.

## Grade 5

Grade 5 students work with more sophisticated platform features: cloud variables for data persistence, simple translations, and integrations that require them to think about data flow and dependencies.

### T33.G5.01 – Use cloud variables to save data online

- **Short name:** Save data in the cloud
- **Description:** Students use CreatiCode's cloud variable blocks to store data (like a player's name or high score) online. They understand that this data persists between sessions—when they close the project and reopen it, the data is still there. Cloud variables enable simple data persistence and sharing across multiple plays.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, guided exploration. Starter project initializes a cloud variable (e.g., "high score") and uses blocks to set and read it. Students modify the variable (e.g., increase the high score) and close/reopen the project to verify the data persists. Auto‑grading checks cloud variable blocks and data state.
- **CSTA:** E5‑SAS‑IM‑04, DAA‑DF/DP (data persistence and storage).

### T33.G5.02 – Translate text using an external API

- **Short name:** Translate text with an API
- **Description:** Students use a translation block (or Google Translate integration) to convert text from one language to another. They understand that the text is sent to a translation service and the translated result comes back.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, starter project. A sprite or variable holds a sentence. Students use a translate block to convert it to a different language, then display or speak the result. Auto‑grading checks the translate block is present and functioning.
- **CSTA:** E5‑CAS‑ET‑02, DAA‑DF (transforming data via external service).

### T33.G5.03 – Understand data flow between tools (diagram)

- **Short name:** Trace how data flows between tools
- **Description:** Students trace or diagram how data moves when using external services. For example: "I ask the AI a question (data out) → OpenAI processes it (external service) → My project receives the answer (data back in)." This is a conceptual skill building understanding of request-response cycles.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, diagram or labeling. Show a simple diagram with arrows showing data flow between a CreatiCode project and an external service. Students label or complete the diagram with terms like "request," "response," "internet," etc. Auto‑grading checks correct labeling.
- **CSTA:** E5‑SAS‑IM‑04, SAS‑NW (understanding network communication).

### T33.G5.04 – Recognize benefits and risks of using external services

- **Short name:** Pros and cons of using external APIs
- **Description:** Students list or discuss advantages (e.g., "I can add voice without building it myself") and disadvantages (e.g., "If the service goes down, my project stops working") of relying on external APIs and services. This builds critical thinking about technological dependencies.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, sorting or discussion. Given a list of scenarios or statements about using external services, students sort into "advantages" and "disadvantages." Auto‑grading checks the sort accuracy.
- **CSTA:** E5‑SAS‑IM‑04, E5‑CAS‑ET‑02.

## Grade 6

Middle school (6–8) students work with more complex platform integrations and begin to think about ethical and technical dimensions of APIs and external services.

### T33.G6.01 – Trace data sent to external services

- **Short name:** Understand what data leaves your project
- **Description:** Students examine a CreatiCode project that uses external services (like ChatGPT or speech recognition) and identify what data is being sent from their project to the external service. For example, "When I use speech recognition, my audio is sent to Google/OpenAI." They consider what personal information might be included.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, analysis. Show a project using one or more external services (ChatGPT, speech, image generation, translation). Students list or identify what data is being sent and why. Auto‑grading checks correct identification of data types.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑11, MS‑CAS‑ET‑04 (evaluating design choices and impacts).

### T33.G6.02 – Evaluate privacy of using external services

- **Short name:** Think about privacy when using APIs
- **Description:** Students learn that when a CreatiCode project uses external services, some of their data (like typed text, voice, images) is sent to those services. They evaluate privacy policies or think about what happens to that data. Do they feel comfortable sharing? Should there be safeguards?
- **Challenge format:** Concept, analysis. Students are given a scenario: "Your project uses ChatGPT and sends all the questions players type to OpenAI servers. Is this okay? Why/why not?" or "Should student speech be saved by a speech-to-text service?" Students justify their answers. Auto‑grading scores reasoning using rubric keywords.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑11, CAS‑ET (ethics of external services and data).

### T33.G6.03 – Use multiplayer blocks to sync game state

- **Short name:** Sync data in a multiplayer game
- **Description:** Students use CreatiCode's multiplayer blocks to create a simple networked game where two players' actions are synchronized. They broadcast sprite positions or game state to all players via the multiplayer server, understanding that the server is an external service that stores and relays data.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, starter project or challenge. A simple two-player game skeleton is provided (e.g., a shared sprite position). Students add multiplayer blocks to create/join a game and broadcast position updates. Auto‑grading checks multiplayer block structure and that both players' screens stay in sync in test runs.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑11, MS‑CAS‑ET‑06 (using emerging/network technology).

### T33.G6.04 – Identify and handle API errors gracefully

- **Short name:** Handle broken connections or failed requests
- **Description:** Students learn that API calls can fail (no internet, service down, invalid request). They design or improve a project to handle these failures gracefully—e.g., showing a message "Can't reach AI service, try again later" instead of crashing silently.
- **Challenge format:** Coding or debugging, challenge/refactor. A starter project uses an external service but has no error handling. Students add checks or alternative behaviors (e.g., "if response is empty, show message"). Auto‑grading verifies error-handling blocks are present and the project behaves reasonably when the service is simulated to fail.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑TR‑01 (testing and refining), SAS‑IM.

### T33.G7.02 – Trace a multi-service project architecture

- **Short name:** Understand a project's external dependencies
- **Description:** Given a more complex CreatiCode project that uses multiple external services (e.g., ChatGPT, speech, multiplayer, cloud variables), students map out and describe which services it relies on, what data flows between them, and what would break if each service failed.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, diagramming or explanation. Show a diagram of a complex project with multiple integrations, or present the code/blocks. Students create or complete a dependency diagram showing project → external services. Auto‑grading checks that identified dependencies are correct and explained.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑12, SAS‑NW (understanding networked systems).

### T33.G7.03 – Evaluate algorithmic bias in AI services

- **Short name:** Recognize bias in AI tools
- **Description:** Students learn that AI services (like ChatGPT, translation, or image generation) can have biases. For example, ChatGPT might give different answers based on how a question is phrased, or an image generator might produce stereotyped results. Students think about impacts and responsibility.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, exploration or discussion. Students are prompted: "Use ChatGPT in CreatiCode to ask it a question twice with slightly different wording. Do the answers differ?" Or "Generate images with different keywords and see if they differ in problematic ways." They reflect on what they observe. Auto‑grading is rubric-based on thoughtfulness.
- **CSTA:** MS‑CAS‑ET‑07, CAS‑ET (ethics and impacts of technology).

### T33.G7.04 – Design for offline resilience

- **Short name:** Make a project work without internet
- **Description:** Students design or modify a CreatiCode project to work as much as possible even when the internet is down or external services fail. For example, storing some data locally, caching API responses, or offering offline alternatives. This builds thinking about robustness.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, design challenge. Starter project relies fully on external services. Students redesign it to gracefully degrade—caching responses, using local data, showing helpful error messages. Auto‑grading checks that the project has offline fallback logic.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑12, PRO‑PM (program design and resilience).

---

## Grade 8

Grade 8 brings students to the threshold of high school thinking: they evaluate the societal and environmental impacts of platforms and APIs, and consider career and ethical implications.

### T33.G8.01 – Analyze the business model of a platform

- **Short name:** How do platforms make money?
- **Description:** Students learn that platforms like CreatiCode, YouTube, or ChatGPT have business models: some are free with ads, some charge subscriptions, and some collect and sell user data. Students analyze the trade-offs and ethical implications.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, research and analysis. Students research and explain: "CreatiCode is free. How might they make money or sustain the service?" Possible answers include ads (none yet), future premium features, data collection (limited), or grants. Students justify their thinking. Auto‑grading is rubric-based on reasoning.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑12, CAS‑ET (impacts of technology and ethical considerations).

### T33.G8.02 – Evaluate environmental impact of cloud services

- **Short name:** Cloud services and environmental cost

- **Challenge format:** Concept, discussion or analysis. Students read or view a short explanation of data center energy use, then discuss: "Using cloud storage and AI services has environmental costs. Is it worth it? When should we use local alternatives?" Auto‑grading scores reasoning.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑12, CAS‑ET (environmental impacts).

### T33.G8.03 – Consider digital equity and access

- **Short name:** Not everyone can access the same platforms
- **Description:** Students recognize that access to platforms and APIs is not universal—students in low-income areas, rural regions, or developing countries may lack reliable internet. They think about implications: What happens to their project if someone doesn't have internet? How should platform creators think about equity?
- **Challenge format:** Concept, discussion or scenario analysis. Scenario: "You created a game on CreatiCode that uses AI. Your cousin in a rural area with slow internet can't play it. What could you change?" Students propose solutions (local alternatives, offline modes, etc.). Auto‑grading checks empathy and problem-solving.
- **CSTA:** MS‑SAS‑IM‑11, CAS‑ET (equity and access).

### T33.G8.04 – Plan a responsible project using external services

- **Short name:** Design an ethical project with APIs

## Summary

The T33 skills track builds from recognizing platforms and tools in K–2, to using them with CreatiCode in grades 3–5, to understanding their impacts and ethical dimensions in grades 6–8. The progression emphasizes:

1. **Awareness** (K–2): Tools exist, are created by others, and have benefits and risks.
2. **Use & Exploration** (3–5): Hands-on use of CreatiCode's integrations (ChatGPT, speech, images, cloud storage) and understanding basic data flow.
3. **Analysis & Ethics** (6–8): Evaluating dependencies, privacy, bias, environmental impact, and equity implications of relying on external services.

Throughout, students maintain agency: they use tools responsibly, understand their limitations, and think critically about their role in a connected, data-driven world.
