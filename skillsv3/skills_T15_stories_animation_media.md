- **Challenge format:** Coding, creative challenge. Provided: large scene backdrop or multiple sprites spread across space. Prompt: "Create a scene where the 'camera' zooms in on a character as they speak, then pans to show a second character's reaction." Auto‑grading checks that sprite scale changes or position-tracking logic is present and produces the intended focus effect.
- **CSTA:** E5‑PRO‑PF‑01.

### T15.G5.04 – Layered audio design (music, ambiance, effects)

- **Short name:** Dynamic audio mixing and transitions

### T15.G8.01 – Implement a narrative engine with state and dialogue data

- **Short name:** Build a dialogue and story system
- **Description:** Students design and code a simple narrative engine that separates story data (dialogue, choices, state changes) from the presentation logic. For example, a "dialogue table" holds character lines and conditions; the engine checks conditions, displays the right line, and updates state.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, algorithmic challenge. Provided: a data structure (list/table) for dialogue and a basic engine stub. Prompt: "Create a dialogue system where a table stores: character name, line of text, required state, and next state change. The engine reads this table and displays dialogue while updating state."
