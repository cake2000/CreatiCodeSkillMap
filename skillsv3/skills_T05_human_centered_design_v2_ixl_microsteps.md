# T05 – Human‑Centered Design: K–8 Skill List (v2, IXL‑Style Microsteps)

Topic reference: `T05 Human‑Centered Design` in `domains_topics_overview.md`  
Domain: Algorithms & Design (D1) · Primary CSTA focus: ALG‑HD (with links to ALG‑IM, ALG‑AF, PRO‑PF, DAA‑DI)

This v2 version refines the original draft (`skills_T05_human_centered_design.md`) into an **IXL‑style microstep design**:

- **Role of T05:** Focused on *human‑centered design* (empathy, user needs, accessibility, iteration) and *simulation planning* (what to model, what to simplify, what data to collect) when creating or evaluating technologies and projects. It assumes core algorithm skills from **T01**, representation/tracing skills from **T02**, and project‑planning skills from **T03**, and layers user‑ and data‑centered thinking on top.  
- **Microsteps:** Each skill targets a small, explicit practice (identify needs, describe a user, spot usability issues, choose accessibility improvements, pick simulation variables, interpret feedback/data, etc.) rather than broad design bundles. Within each strand, IXL‑style microsteps move from “notice” → “categorize” → “propose one change” → “compare/explain,” with no big jumps.  
- **Uneven density:** Heavier scaffolding in **grades 3–6**, where students start designing their own apps and interactive experiences with CreatiCode; lighter but meaningful K–2 foundations and more analytical 7–8 work.  
- **Implementability:** All skills can be run as picture‑based tasks, small planning forms, structured prompts around CreatiCode projects, or simple checklists; no free‑form essays required to auto‑grade.

IDs follow `T05.G<grade>.<nn>`. v1 IDs are preserved conceptually; new microsteps use higher `<nn>` values.

### Notes on Dependencies and Alignment

- K–2: T05 builds on general reasoning and picture‑based tasks; it depends lightly on T01/T02 for sequence and representation ideas but keeps the focus on *who* is helped and what makes tools easier to use. Simulation mentions are very high‑level (“could this be simulated?”) and do not overlap with core algorithm topics.  
- G3–5: HCD and simulation planning skills depend on basic project ideas and data concepts from other topics (e.g., T03 decomposition, T25–T27 data) and are intended to precede or accompany coding in topics like T14–T20 and T17/T28. T05 covers **what to build and test for humans and what to model/test in simulations**, while T01–T04 focus on algorithm structure and patterns.  
- G6–8: T05 skills assume students can build small apps and simulations (T06–T13, T17, T25–T27) and focus on planning, evaluation, and iteration using HCD and DAA‑DI practices. They are supports for larger design/simulation projects rather than prerequisites for learning core constructs.  
- This design matches CSTA ALG‑HD and DAA‑DI progressions, keeps each skill narrow, auto‑gradable, and CreatiCode‑implementable, and makes T05 complementary to T01 (everyday algorithms), T02 (algorithm diagrams), T03 (project planning/decomposition), and T04 (patterns & reusable solutions).
