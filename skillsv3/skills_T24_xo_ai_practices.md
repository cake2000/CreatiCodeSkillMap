## Grade K (PreK–K)

In Kindergarten, students begin developing awareness of how to ask for help and describe what they want to make. Emphasis is on expressing ideas simply and learning that adults and tools (like XO) can help with planning.

### T24.GK.01 – Tell what you want to make

- **Short name:** Say what you want to create
- **Description:** Students practice expressing a simple creative idea (e.g., "I want to make a game with a cat," "I want to make a story about a dinosaur") in words or pictures. This is the foundation for later using XO to plan projects. Students learn that stating ideas clearly is the first step.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, teacher-guided or open sharing. A teacher or peer asks, "What do you want to make today?" Students respond with a simple sentence or drawing. Assessment is observational: can the student communicate an intent?
- **CSTA:** EK‑PRO‑PM‑06 (Create a programming sequence to complete a task, working with a partner).

### T24.GK.02 – Ask an adult for help with ideas

- **Short name:** Ask for help planning
- **Description:** Students practice asking a teacher, peer, or AI assistant (e.g., "What should my project have?") and listening to suggestions. This builds the habit of seeking guidance and understanding that others can offer ideas.
- **Challenge format:** Interactive, class or small group. A student is given a simple project goal (e.g., "You want to make a sprite move"). The teacher or XO offers 2–3 suggestions (e.g., "You could press a key to make it move," "You could add a sound"). The student selects one. Observation/discussion confirms understanding.
- **CSTA:** EK‑PRO‑PM‑05 (Articulate how one has completed a task or solved a problem that takes multiple steps).

---

## Grade 1

Grade 1 deepens the ability to describe project ideas and begins collaborating with peers and AI to plan. Students learn that XO can help with multiple aspects (what to make, how to start) and practice rephrasing ideas when they don't understand an answer.

### T24.G1.01 – Describe your project idea in a sentence

- **Short name:** Explain your idea
- **Description:** Students articulate a complete (but simple) project idea in one or two sentences, including what the project does and who uses it (e.g., "I'm making a game where you click the cat to score points"). This develops clarity in communication before coding.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, written or spoken. A student is shown a half-completed idea ("I want to make a game") and must complete it with a detail ("...where you avoid the obstacles"). The student writes or dictates their full idea. Assessment checks for specificity.
- **CSTA:** E1‑PRO‑PM‑04 (Explain the function of a code segment); E1‑PRO‑PM‑05 (Collaborate with a partner to develop a program).

### T24.G1.02 – Ask XO for project ideas

- **Short name:** Get ideas from XO
- **Description:** Students use XO (in structured conversation or guided prompts) to ask "Give me ideas for a project using [topic]" and receive suggestions. They learn that XO is a brainstorming partner and that AI can suggest multiple directions.
- **Challenge format:** Interactive, guided task. A student opens XO and selects from template prompts like "Give me project ideas for a story" or types a simple request. XO returns 2–3 project ideas. The student picks one and explains why. Auto-grading checks that a legitimate idea was selected and the student gave a reason (e.g., "I chose the adventure game because I like games").
- **CSTA:** E1‑PRO‑PM‑04, E1‑PRO‑PM‑05.

### T24.G1.03 – Ask for help starting a project

- **Short name:** Ask XO for first steps
- **Description:** Once a student has a project idea, they ask XO "How do I start making a [project type]?" and receive a high-level outline (e.g., "First, draw your character. Then, add a button to start."). Students learn to ask sequential questions.
- **Challenge format:** Concept and interactive. A student is given a project goal (e.g., "Make a story"). They ask XO for first steps via a template or natural prompt. XO returns an outline. The student selects the first step they would do. Assessment checks if they chose a logical starting point.
- **CSTA:** E1‑PRO‑PM‑05.

---

## Grade 2

Grade 2 adds understanding of when to ask XO for help (planning vs. problem-solving), the ability to follow a multi-step plan from XO, and practice rephrasing questions when the first answer doesn't help.

### T24.G2.01 – Decide when to ask XO: planning vs. coding

- **Short name:** Know when to ask XO
- **Description:** Students distinguish between questions XO helps with (e.g., "What features should my game have?" or "How do I structure the code?") and questions better answered by trying (e.g., "Why doesn't this block work?" - better to debug directly). This teaches responsible use of AI as a guide, not a crutch.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice or sorting. A list of questions is shown (e.g., "What should I put in my game?" "Why is this sprite flickering?" "What do I code first?"). Students sort them into "Ask XO first" and "Try it yourself first" categories. Auto-grading checks that planning/big-picture questions are in the XO category and specific debugging is in the "try first" category.
- **CSTA:** E2‑PRO‑PM‑04 (Document the steps taken and choices made), E2‑PRO‑PM‑05 (Use structured constructive feedback from a peer).

### T24.G2.02 – Follow a multi-step plan from XO

- **Short name:** Follow XO's project outline
- **Description:** Students receive a step-by-step plan from XO (e.g., 5 steps to make a game) and execute them in order, checking off each step as they complete it. This builds project management skills and shows that breaking a project into steps makes it manageable.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, guided project. XO provides a 4–5 step outline for a project (e.g., "Make the sprites," "Add keyboard controls," "Add a score variable," etc.). The student works through the steps in order, optionally marking them as complete. Auto-grading checks that the student's final project has the key components from all steps (e.g., sprites exist, controls work, score displays).
- **CSTA:** E2‑PRO‑PM‑04, E2‑PRO‑PM‑05.

### T24.G2.03 – Rephrase a question if XO's answer doesn't help

- **Short name:** Ask again if unclear
- **Description:** If a student asks XO "How do I make my sprite jump?" and the answer is too vague, they learn to rephrase it with more detail ("How do I make a sprite jump when I press the spacebar?") to get a more targeted response. This teaches iterative communication with AI.
- **Challenge format:** Interactive, dialogue simulation. The system shows a student's question and XO's vague answer (e.g., Q: "How do I make a game?" A: "You can make many types of games!"). The student chooses a better rephrasing from options or writes one. Auto-grading checks if the new question is more specific (includes a game type, mechanic, or constraint).
- **CSTA:** E2‑PRO‑PM‑04, E2‑PRO‑PM‑05.

---

## Grade 3

Grade 3 introduces the habit of reflecting on code with AI help. Students learn to ask XO "What could I improve?" or "Does this make sense?" and to act on constructive feedback while maintaining ownership of their work.

### T24.G3.01 – Ask XO to review your code idea

- **Short name:** Have XO check your plan
- **Description:** Before coding, a student describes their algorithm or plan to XO (e.g., "My plan is to repeat moving the sprite forward 10 times and then turn. Will this make a square?") and asks XO to spot issues or confirm it will work. This shifts XO use from brainstorming to validation.
- **Challenge format:** Concept and interactive. A student writes a 1–2 sentence plan for a small feature. They paste or describe it to XO and ask "Will this work?" or "What's wrong with this?" XO provides feedback. The student selects a feedback item (e.g., "The rotation angle is wrong") and explains what they'll change. Auto-grading checks that the student identifies a valid issue.
- **CSTA:** E3‑PRO‑PM‑05 (Articulate the function of a specific aspect of a program), E3‑PRO‑PM‑06 (Collaborate with a team).

### T24.G3.02 – Get improvement suggestions from XO, then decide

- **Short name:** Ask for improvements, choose your own
- **Description:** After completing a simple project or feature, a student asks XO "What could I improve?" and receives suggestions (e.g., "You could add sound," "You could make the movement smoother," "You could add a title screen"). The student picks one improvement they want to make, reinforcing their agency.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, reflection task. A student completes a starter project (e.g., a simple game). They ask XO "What are 2–3 ways I could improve this?" XO lists options. The student selects one they like and explains why (e.g., "I want to add sound because it will be more fun"). Auto-grading checks that a selection was made and a reason was given.
- **CSTA:** E3‑PRO‑PM‑05, E3‑PRO‑PM‑06.

### T24.G3.03 – Describe a bug to XO; try XO's suggestions before fixing it yourself

- **Short name:** Use XO for debugging hints
- **Description:** When a student encounters a bug (e.g., "My sprite is stuck in a corner"), they describe it to XO (not paste full code, just explain) and ask for hints on what to check. XO might suggest "Check if you're resetting the position" or "Look at your loop condition." The student tries these hints. If a hint doesn't work, they continue debugging independently, learning that XO is a guide, not a solution.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, debugging task. A project with an intentional bug is provided (e.g., a sprite moves but never stops). The student describes the problem to XO and receives 2–3 debugging hints. They implement one hint and test. Auto-grading checks if they applied one hint and if the project behavior improved (or stayed the same if the bug is elsewhere).
- **CSTA:** E3‑PRO‑TR‑03 (Debug errors in iteration or selection in a program); E3‑PRO‑PM‑05.

---

## Grade 4

Grade 4 deepens reflection on code quality and design choices. Students learn to ask XO deeper design questions ("Is there a better way to organize this?") and to evaluate AI suggestions critically before adopting them.

### T24.G4.01 – Ask XO if your code is well-organized

- **Short name:** Check code organization with XO
- **Description:** A student writes or pastes a short script and asks XO "Is this organized well?" or "Could I use a custom block here?" XO suggests refactoring opportunities. The student decides whether to adopt the suggestion based on understanding (not blind acceptance).
- **Challenge format:** Coding, refactoring with feedback. A script with repeated code is shown (e.g., four nearly-identical movement sequences). The student asks XO how to improve it. XO suggests using a loop or custom block. The student chooses whether to refactor and why (e.g., "Yes, a loop makes it cleaner" vs. "No, I'll keep it simple"). Auto-grading checks that the student made a choice and gave reasoning.
- **CSTA:** E4‑PRO‑PM‑05 (Document a program, using embedded or external comments); E4‑PRO‑TR‑03 (Debug errors in a program).

### T24.G4.02 – Discuss design choices with XO, then justify your decision

- **Short name:** Explain why you coded it that way
- **Description:** After completing a project, a student asks XO "Why is my solution good?" or "Are there trade-offs I should know about?" XO explains pros and cons of the student's approach. The student then articulates their reasoning: "I used a loop because it's shorter" or "I used if/else because it's clearer to me." This reinforces that coding decisions involve values (clarity, efficiency, simplicity) and that the student's voice matters.
- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding, reflection. A student shows their completed code to XO and asks for an evaluation. XO provides balanced feedback. The student writes or speaks 1–2 sentences about why they chose their approach. Auto-grading checks for thoughtful response (e.g., addresses clarity, efficiency, or simplicity).
- **CSTA:** E4‑PRO‑PM‑05, E4‑PRO‑PM‑06 (Construct individual components of a program that are collaboratively assembled).

### T24.G4.03 – Recognize when XO doesn't know the answer

- **Short name:** Know XO's limits
- **Description:** Students learn that XO sometimes gives generic answers or slightly incorrect suggestions, especially for CreatiCode-specific features or edge cases. They practice saying "That suggestion doesn't fit my project" or asking a peer/teacher instead. This builds critical thinking and prevents over-reliance on AI.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, case study or dialogue. Students are shown examples where XO gives imperfect advice (e.g., XO suggests a feature that doesn't exist in CreatiCode, or misunderstands the project). For each case, the student identifies the issue (e.g., "XO forgot that this is CreatiCode, not Scratch") and suggests an alternative (ask a teacher, check the docs, try a different approach). Auto-grading checks that the student identified a limitation or error.
- **CSTA:** E4‑PRO‑TR‑03; E4‑PRO‑PM‑05.

---

## Grade 5

Grade 5 emphasizes collaborative feedback loops: asking XO for input, iterating based on feedback, and documenting why choices were made. Students practice responsible AI use and understand that AI feedback is one input among many (peer feedback, teacher feedback, their own testing).

### T24.G5.01 – Ask XO about algorithm efficiency

- **Short name:** Compare solutions with XO
- **Description:** Given multiple ways to solve a problem (e.g., two different loop structures, two different variable organizations), a student asks XO "Which is better and why?" XO explains trade-offs (clarity vs. speed, etc.). The student then decides based on their project needs.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice with explanation. Two code snippets for the same task are shown. The student asks XO which is better or why they differ. XO explains. The student selects the one they'd use and justifies it (e.g., "I'd use the first because it's clearer for my audience").
- **CSTA:** E5‑PRO‑PM‑05 (Create embedded or external documentation), E5‑PRO‑TR‑03 (Debug programs, using systematic strategies).

### T24.G5.02 – Create a project plan with XO, then document your decisions

- **Short name:** Plan and document with XO
- **Description:** A student asks XO for a detailed project plan (e.g., all steps to make a platformer game), receives the outline, follows it while taking notes on why they chose each step or what they changed. They then write a brief project report documenting their decisions and how they differ from XO's suggestion.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, project with documentation. A student uses XO to plan a project, builds it (following the plan or deviating where it makes sense), and writes a short reflection (e.g., "XO suggested 5 steps. I used 4 because I combined collision and scoring"). Auto-grading checks for a real project with at least 3 key components and a reflection that mentions at least one decision.
- **CSTA:** E5‑PRO‑PM‑05, E5‑PRO‑PM‑06 (Collaborate with peers to design, implement, document, and review a programming project).

### T24.G5.03 – Combine feedback from XO, peer, and your own testing

- **Short name:** Use multiple feedback sources
- **Description:** After completing a feature or project, a student gathers feedback from XO ("What do you think of this?"), a peer ("Does it work well?"), and their own testing ("Does it do what I want?"). They analyze all three inputs and decide what to change based on their priorities.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, iterative challenge. A student builds a simple interactive feature (e.g., a button that does something). They collect feedback: ask XO, have a peer test it, and personally test edge cases. They then list the feedback received and explain one change they'll make based on what they learned. Auto-grading checks for feedback from at least two sources and at least one change.
- **CSTA:** E5‑PRO‑PM‑05, E5‑PRO‑PM‑06, E5‑PRO‑TR‑03.

### T24.G5.04 – Recognize bias or limitations in XO's suggestions

- **Short name:** Think critically about XO advice
- **Description:** Students learn that XO may favor certain approaches (e.g., always suggest a loop even when if/else is simpler, or not know about CreatiCode-specific blocks). They practice saying "This suggestion doesn't fit my project" and explaining why. This builds metacognitive awareness.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, case study. Scenarios are presented where XO gives a reasonable but not-optimal suggestion. The student explains what XO might have missed and proposes a better approach. Example: XO suggests a loop for a one-time action; the student recognizes that's overkill and proposes a single block instead.
- **CSTA:** E5‑PRO‑PM‑05, E5‑PRO‑TR‑03; broader CAS‑ET alignment (thinking critically about tools).

---

## Grade 6

In middle school, students transition from learning to use XO to becoming more autonomous about when and how to use it. They ask more sophisticated questions, evaluate XO's responses against documentation and their own understanding, and practice responsible AI use including attribution.

### T24.G6.01 – Ask XO for algorithm design help

- **Short name:** Design algorithms with XO
- **Description:** Given a complex task (e.g., "How do I search a list for a value?"), a student asks XO for a conceptual outline or pseudocode, not full code. XO provides steps. The student implements it and documents where their code came from. This combines AI assistance with student problem-solving.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, algorithm challenge. A task is described (e.g., "Find the smallest number in a list"). The student asks XO for a high-level approach (not code). XO provides pseudocode or a flowchart idea. The student codes it in CreatiCode blocks and includes a comment like "Algorithm from XO; implemented by [student name]" or "Inspired by XO's suggestion." Auto-grading checks for a working solution and proper attribution.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PM‑15 (Apply inclusive collaboration practices).

### T24.G6.02 – Cross-check XO advice with documentation or peers

- **Short name:** Verify XO's suggestions
- **Description:** When XO suggests a solution, a student learns to verify it: "Does the CreatiCode docs say this is right?" or "Does this match what my peer said?" This prevents adopting incorrect or outdated advice.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, evaluation. A student is given XO's suggestion (e.g., "Use the 'repeat loop' block with a condition"). They are asked to verify it by (1) checking the CreatiCode knowledge base, (2) asking a peer, or (3) testing it in a project. They report back: "Verified: this works as XO described" or "XO's suggestion was wrong; the correct block is…" Auto-grading checks for evidence of verification.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PM‑15, MS‑PRO‑TR‑11 (Use standard practices to test, debug, document, and peer-review code).

### T24.G6.03 – Ask XO to explain code and assess the explanation

- **Short name:** Get code explanations from XO
- **Description:** A student pastes a short script (their own or a peer's) and asks XO "What does this do?" XO explains the logic. The student assesses: "Is that right?" by tracing the code or testing it. If there's a mismatch, they ask a follow-up question or correct XO.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, code analysis. A script is shown. The student asks XO to explain it in 2–3 sentences. XO provides an explanation. The student then judges the explanation (true/false or multiple choice: "Is XO right?" "What part did XO misunderstand?"). Auto-grading checks the judgment.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PF‑01 (Analyze how a segment of code works by identifying and describing the roles of key components); MS‑PRO‑PM‑16 (Document a program, using comments, descriptive names, and structured guides).

### T24.G6.04 – Balance XO assistance with peer collaboration and independent work

- **Short name:** Use XO alongside peers and solo work
- **Description:** Students learn that a healthy project workflow includes asking XO (for big ideas), collaborating with peers (for diverse perspectives), and working alone (for deep understanding). They practice deciding which mode to use when.
- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding, mixed project. A student completes a project over several days or checkpoints. They log when they used XO, when they asked a peer, and when they worked alone. They reflect: "I asked XO for the overall plan, then worked alone on the details, then got feedback from a peer. This helped because…" Auto-grading checks for varied use and thoughtful reflection.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PM‑15.

---

## Grade 7

Grade 7 emphasizes sophisticated use of AI as a thinking partner in design and refactoring. Students ask XO about trade-offs, edge cases, and optimization, and they integrate AI feedback into a broader problem-solving process.

### T24.G7.01 – Ask XO about edge cases and robustness

- **Short name:** Plan for edge cases with XO
- **Description:** Before or after implementing a solution, a student asks XO "What edge cases might break my code?" or "How do I make my solution more robust?" XO suggests cases (negative numbers, empty lists, etc.). The student tests or implements guards against them.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, robustness challenge. A solution is provided (e.g., code to divide two numbers). The student asks XO what could go wrong. XO lists edge cases (dividing by zero, etc.). The student adds checks (e.g., "if divisor is 0, show an error"). Auto-grading checks that the solution now handles at least 2 edge cases correctly.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑TR‑11, MS‑PRO‑TR‑12 (Modify a program to improve usability and accessibility).

### T24.G7.02 – Discuss trade-offs: speed vs. clarity with XO

- **Short name:** Evaluate design trade-offs
- **Description:** Students understand that many coding decisions involve trade-offs (a loop is faster but a function call is clearer; a variable is flexible but a constant is predictable). They ask XO "Which is better for my goal?" and make informed choices based on their priorities.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, evaluation. Two solutions with different trade-offs are presented (e.g., a nested loop that's fast but hard to read vs. a clearer loop with helper functions). The student asks XO to explain the trade-off. They then choose one for a specific scenario and justify it (e.g., "For a competition, speed matters, so I'll use the nested loop").
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PF‑01, MS‑ALG‑AF‑02 (Describe how data is taken in, stored, processed, and produced as output).

### T24.G7.03 – Use XO to refactor and improve existing code

- **Short name:** Ask XO for refactoring ideas
- **Description:** After completing a working solution, a student shows it to XO and asks "How could I make this better?" XO suggests refactoring (extract a function, use a data structure, simplify a condition). The student implements one or two suggestions and documents why.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, refactoring task. A working but imperfect project is provided. The student asks XO for 2–3 improvements. They implement one improvement, document the change (e.g., "I extracted a custom block because it reduces repeated code"), and confirm the refactored code still works. Auto-grading checks for a successful refactoring and documentation.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PF‑01, MS‑PRO‑PM‑16.

### T24.G7.04 – Critique XO's suggestions against your priorities

- **Short name:** Evaluate whether XO's idea fits your project
- **Description:** XO might suggest a sophisticated optimization or feature that's technically sound but doesn't align with a student's project goals (e.g., XO suggests a complex sorting algorithm when the student's list is tiny, or XO suggests a 3D feature when the project is 2D). Students learn to say "That's smart, but not what I need for this project" and explain why.
- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding, decision-making. XO suggests an improvement (e.g., "Use a hash table for O(1) lookups"). The student assesses: "Is this important for my project?" They explain their reasoning (e.g., "My list has only 10 items, so a simple loop is fine. I'll stick with it."). Auto-grading checks for a thoughtful evaluation.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PM‑16, broader algorithmic thinking (MS‑ALG‑AF‑02, MS‑ALG‑PS).

---

## Grade 8

Grade 8 treats XO as a professional-level tool: students use it for documentation, collaboration notes, and meta-level thinking. They ask XO for help analyzing their own learning process and use AI-supported reflection to improve their computational thinking.

### T24.G8.01 – Use XO to help document a complex project

- **Short name:** Generate documentation with XO
- **Description:** After completing a multi-feature project, a student shows XO the code and asks "Help me write clear documentation for a peer to understand this." XO provides a structured outline (overview, features, code breakdown). The student refines it with their own details and perspective, creating a hybrid human-AI document.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, documentation task. A student's complex project (5+ features) is completed. They ask XO to help document it. XO provides a template or outline. The student writes or edits the documentation, adding their own explanations. Auto-grading checks for documentation that includes an overview, a feature list, and at least one code explanation.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PM‑16, MS‑PRO‑PM‑15.

### T24.G8.02 – Reflect on your coding decisions with XO's help

- **Short name:** Use XO for self-reflection
- **Description:** A student completes a project and asks XO "What strengths do you see in my code?" or "What would I improve if I had more time?" XO provides feedback. The student integrates this with their own self-assessment ("I was proud that I used a loop to reduce repetition. Next time, I'd…").
- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding, reflection. After project completion, the student asks XO for constructive feedback and identifies one strength and one area to improve next time. They write a brief reflection (e.g., "I used a custom block to organize my code well. Next, I'd add comments."). Auto-grading checks for self-aware reflection integrating XO input.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑PM‑16; broader metacognitive alignment (thinking about thinking).

### T24.G8.03 – Ask XO to help debug by explaining your hypothesis

- **Short name:** Use XO to test debugging theories
- **Description:** Before diving into code, a student tells XO their hypothesis about a bug ("I think the sprite is stuck because the loop never ends"). XO helps them design a test (add a print statement, add a timer, etc.). The student tests and reports back. This combines logical reasoning with AI-assisted verification.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, debugging. A buggy project is given. The student states a hypothesis about the problem. They ask XO "How would I test if my hypothesis is right?" XO suggests tests. The student implements one test and reports the result. Auto-grading checks that the hypothesis is reasonable, the test is logical, and the student followed through.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑TR‑11, MS‑PRO‑PF‑01.

### T24.G8.04 – Recognize and mitigate limitations of XO-assisted code

- **Short name:** Verify XO code quality
- **Description:** Sometimes XO-generated code or suggestions work but aren't ideal (inefficient, unclear, not fully correct). Grade 8 students learn to review code XO suggests, test it thoroughly, and either adopt it with understanding or revise it. They practice the principle: "AI is a tool, not an authority."
- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding, code review. XO provides a code suggestion for a task. The student reads it, tests it on multiple cases, and writes a brief review (e.g., "This works, but it's a bit unclear because… I'd add a comment" or "This is inefficient because… I'd use a loop instead"). Auto-grading checks for evidence of testing and critical evaluation.
- **CSTA:** MS‑PRO‑TR‑13 (Describe issues of accuracy and bias in computer-generated code); MS‑PRO‑TR‑11.

## Notes on Assessment and Inclusivity

All skills in T24 emphasize **student agency** and **responsible AI use**:

- XO is always positioned as an **assistant**, not a replacement for student thinking. Challenges never let students simply copy XO's response.
- **Reflection and justification** are central: students explain why they accept or reject XO suggestions.
- **Multiple modalities** are supported: talking to XO, reading XO's response, writing your own thoughts, pairing with peers.
- **Accessibility considerations**: Students who struggle with reading or writing can use speech-to-text to talk to XO and text-to-speech to hear XO's responses.
- **Inclusive design**: XO is framed as helpful to all learners (not only "advanced" students), especially those who benefit from extra scaffolding or diverse perspectives.

These skills align with CSTA's **PRO‑PM (Project Management)** standards, which emphasize collaboration, documentation, and inclusive practices. They also support broader **Computational Thinking** and **Inclusive Collaboration** pillars by teaching students to think critically about tools, work responsibly with AI, and value human creativity and diversity over automation.
