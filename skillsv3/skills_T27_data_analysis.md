## Grade K (PreK–K)

Data analysis at this level is intuitive, informal, and grounded in observable physical collections and simple visual patterns. Students compare groups of objects and begin to notice what is "more" or "less."

### T27.GK.01 – Sort objects into groups by attribute

- **Short name:** Sort objects by one feature
- **Description:** Students physically or virtually sort objects (e.g., buttons, shapes, animals) into groups by a single attribute (color, size, or type). This builds a foundation for understanding categories and counting groups, connecting to how data is organized and analyzed.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, interactive sorting. A CreatiCode project shows a set of objects (shapes, icons, or pictures). Students drag them into labeled bins or tap to select the group they belong to (e.g., "red" or "small"). Auto-grading checks the sorting accuracy.
- **CSTA:** EK‑DAA‑DF‑01 (Demonstrate how people create and collect various types of data).

### T27.GK.02 – Count and compare two groups

- **Short name:** Which group has more?
- **Description:** Students count objects in two small groups (up to 5 each) and determine which group has more, fewer, or the same number. This is an early form of data comparison and simple quantitative reasoning.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, interactive item. A CreatiCode scene shows two groups of objects side by side. Students count and choose the answer "more in A," "more in B," or "same number." Auto-grading checks the selection and allows students to verify by counting together.
- **CSTA:** EK‑DAA‑DF‑01, EK‑DAA‑DI‑02 (Compare questions that can be answered with data).

### T27.GK.03 – Notice a pattern in a simple bar display

- **Short name:** See which bar is tallest or shortest
- **Description:** Students look at a simple pictograph or bar chart using physical objects or colored squares (e.g., a column of red stickers for "apples," blue for "oranges") and identify which bar is tallest or shortest, beginning to understand visual representation of data.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice. A CreatiCode project displays a simple bar chart (made of stacked colored squares or sprite icons). Students choose which category has the most/least or answer "Which bar is taller?" Auto-grading compares the chosen answer.
- **CSTA:** EK‑DAA‑DI‑02, EK‑DAA‑DI‑03 (Recognize patterns).

- **Challenge format:** Concept and coding, guided survey. A CreatiCode project provides a simple question and input buttons or sprite interactions to add votes. Students run the project with peers and the system tracks counts; students then report the result verbally or by selecting the most common answer. Auto-grading checks the count logic.

- **Challenge format:** Coding, guided project. A CreatiCode project has a list variable storing collected data (e.g., list of favorite colors). Students use a loop or a provided template to stamp or place icons on the stage, one per data point, organized by category. Auto-grading checks that each icon is placed and that categories are distinct (e.g., apples in one column, oranges in another).
- **CSTA:** E1‑DAA‑DI‑02, DAA‑DF (Collect and organize data).

### T27.G1.03 – Answer simple questions using counts

- **Short name:** Use counts to answer "How many?"
- **Description:** Given a pictograph or tally display that students created or are shown, they answer simple counting questions: "How many people like blue?" or "Which color do the most people like?"
- **Challenge format:** Concept, multiple choice or numeric input. A CreatiCode scene displays a pictograph. Students count the relevant pictures and enter or select the number, or choose which category has the most. Auto-grading checks the numeric answer or selected option.
- **CSTA:** E1‑DAA‑DF‑01, E1‑DAA‑DI‑02.

They then make a reasonable prediction about what will happen next (e.g., "The temperature has been rising each day; it will probably rise again tomorrow").
- **Challenge format:** Concept or coding. A line chart showing data over time is displayed. Students describe the trend ("increasing," "decreasing," or "cyclical") and predict the next one or two values. Optionally, students code a simple linear extrapolation.
