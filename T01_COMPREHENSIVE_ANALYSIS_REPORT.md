## HIGH Priority Issues (27 Issues)

### Issue 1: T01.G2.16 - Skill too broad, covers multiple concepts
**Skill:** Match code blocks to picture sequences
**Problem:** This skill combines:
1. Understanding what code blocks do
2. Reading picture sequences
3. Matching behaviors between two representations
4. Understanding temporal sequence

**Impact:** Students might struggle with multiple concepts at once
**Recommendation:** Split into:
- T01.G2.16.01: Identify what individual code blocks do
- T01.G2.16.02: Match simple code sequences (2-3 blocks) to picture outcomes
- T01.G2.16.03: Match longer code sequences (4-5 blocks) to picture sequences

### Issue 2: T01.G3.01 - Dependencies unclear, prerequisites not specific enough
**Skill:** Complete a simple script with missing blocks
**Problem:** Dependency on T06.G3.01 only, but this skill requires understanding:
1. What blocks do individually
2. How blocks work in sequence
3. What "completion" means in context

**Recommendation:** Add dependencies on T01.G2.16 (understanding blocks) and T01.G2.17 (identifying block actions)

### Issue 3: T01.G3.03 - Depends on T04.G2.01 which is outside X-2 range
**Skill:** Identify repeated blocks in a script (no loops)
**Problem:** G3 skill depends on T04.G2.01, which is G2. This violates the principle that Grade 3 should already have mastered G2 content.
**Actual issue:** The dependency is appropriate (G3 builds on G2), but may be redundant if this is already covered.
**Recommendation:** Review if T04.G2.01 is necessary or if T01.GK.07/T01.G2.01 are sufficient prerequisites.

### Issue 4: T01.G3.04 - Same cross-topic dependency issue as T01.G3.03
**Skill:** Predict how many times repeated blocks run
**Problem:** Same as Issue 3 - depends on T04.G2.01

**Analysis:** Both T04.G3.02 and T07.G3.01 are G3, so acceptable
**Recommendation:** Ensure T04 and T07 are completed before this skill (sequencing issue)

### Issue 7: T01.G3.07 - Same dependency structure as T01.G3.06
**Skill:** Adjust a repeat count to match a pattern
**Problem/Recommendation:** Same as Issue 6

**Recommendation:** Clarify the conditions for binary search advantage

### Issue 54: T01.G6.07 - Complex design task
**Skill:** Design a flowchart for a multi-step program
**Problem:** Design (creation) is harder than reading/implementing

### Issue 57: T01.G7.04 - No dependencies
**Skill:** Compare efficiency of two algorithms qualitatively
**Problem:** Should depend on prior efficiency skills
**Recommendation:** Add dependencies on T01.G5.06 or T01.G6.02
