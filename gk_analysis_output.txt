========================================================================================================================
MISSING CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCIES (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
========================================================================================================================

1. T06.GK.01 - Order pictures showing a morning routine (event sequence concept)
   Topic: T06 – Events & Sequences
   Issue: Orders pictures (sequencing) without T01 dependency
   Suggested Addition: T01.GK.01 or T01.GK.02
   Rationale: Ordering pictures is the foundational skill in T01.GK.01-02
   Current Dependencies: None

2. T26.GK.01 - Identify countable things in a picture
   Topic: T26 – Data Collection & Logging
   Issue: Involves counting without counting prerequisite
   Suggested Addition: T01.GK.08 (Count how many times) or T10.GK.02 (Count items in each group)
   Rationale: Counting is explicitly mentioned in skill
   Current Dependencies: T09.GK.01

3. T26.GK.02 - Use tokens to log repeated events
   Topic: T26 – Data Collection & Logging
   Issue: About repetition/patterns without pattern prerequisite
   Suggested Addition: T04.GK.01 or T01.GK.07
   Rationale: "Repeat" in skill name indicates pattern concept
   Current Dependencies: T09.GK.01, T26.GK.01

========================================================================================================================
MISSING CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCIES (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)
========================================================================================================================

1. T29.GK.02 - Identify letters in text
   Topic: T29 – Text Data & NLP Foundations
   Issue: Involves counting without counting prerequisite
   Suggested Addition: T01.GK.08 (Count how many times) or T10.GK.02 (Count items in each group)
   Rationale: Counting is explicitly mentioned in skill
   Current Dependencies: T29.GK.01

========================================================================================================================
REDUNDANT TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES
========================================================================================================================

1. T02.GK.03 - Use first/next/last to describe a sequence
   Topic: T02 – Algorithm Diagrams
   Issue: Direct dependency on T01.GK.01 is redundant (reachable via T02.GK.02)
   Fix: Consider removing T01.GK.01 as it's already implied by T02.GK.02

2. T02.GK.04 - Fix one picture that is out of order
   Topic: T02 – Algorithm Diagrams
   Issue: Direct dependency on T02.GK.02 is redundant (reachable via T02.GK.03)
   Fix: Consider removing T02.GK.02 as it's already implied by T02.GK.03

3. T24.GK.03 - Give simple instructions to an AI helper
   Topic: T24 – XO & Generative AI Practices
   Issue: Direct dependency on T24.GK.01 is redundant (reachable via T24.GK.02)
   Fix: Consider removing T24.GK.01 as it's already implied by T24.GK.02

4. T26.GK.02 - Use tokens to log repeated events
   Topic: T26 – Data Collection & Logging
   Issue: Direct dependency on T09.GK.01 is redundant (reachable via T26.GK.01)
   Fix: Consider removing T09.GK.01 as it's already implied by T26.GK.01

5. T29.GK.03 - Recognize that text has meaning
   Topic: T29 – Text Data & NLP Foundations
   Issue: Direct dependency on T29.GK.01 is redundant (reachable via T29.GK.02)
   Fix: Consider removing T29.GK.01 as it's already implied by T29.GK.02
