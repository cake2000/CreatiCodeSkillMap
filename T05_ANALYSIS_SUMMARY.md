3. **Grade-Appropriate** - K-2 picture-based, G3+ block-based coding
4. **Phase 1 Success** - All X-2 rule violations fixed, dependencies cleaned up
5. **Auto-Gradable** - All assessment formats feasible in CreatiCode

## Issues Requiring Phase 2 Review

### High Priority

1. **Heavy G1 Dependencies in G6-G8**
   - T05.G1.01 and T05.G1.02 referenced by 23+ and 21+ skills
   - Creates long-range dependencies (G8→G1)
   - May indicate need for intermediate skill versions

2. **Questionable T01.G6.01 Dependencies**
   - G8 design brief skills depend on "Count comparisons in search algorithms"
   - Why is algorithm efficiency needed for HCD?
   - Appears tangential to design work

3. **T08 (Conditionals) in G3 HCD Process**
   - T05.G3.01 (order HCD steps) depends on T08.G3.01 (simple if)
   - Need to verify conditionals are necessary for design process understanding

### Medium Priority

4. **All G7 Skills Have Same Dependencies**
   - All 6 G7 skills depend on T05.G5.01, G5.02, G5.05
   - Might indicate missing intermediate steps or over-standardization

5. **Isolated Cross-Topic Dependencies**
   - T04.G3.01 (patterns), T07.G3.01 (loops) - verify necessity

6. **Simulation Sub-Topic Consideration**
   - Simulation skills (14) form coherent strand
   - Consider splitting T05-A (HCD) and T05-B (Simulation)?

## Cross-Topic Dependency Summary

| Target Topic | Count | Recommendation |
|--------------|-------|----------------|
| T09 (Variables) | 4 | PRESERVE - essential for simulations |
| T01 (Algorithms) | 5 | REVIEW - especially G6.01 dependencies |
| T08 (Conditionals) | 3 | REVIEW - necessity unclear |
| T06 (Sequences) | 2 | PRESERVE - appropriate |
| T03 (Decomposition) | 1 | PRESERVE - appropriate |
| T04 (Patterns) | 1 | REVIEW - verify necessity |
| T07 (Loops) | 1 | REVIEW - verify necessity |

## Progression Summary

**K-2: Awareness & Recognition**
- K: Tool helpers, ease of use
- 1: User needs identification
- 2: Different users, intro simulations

**G3-4: Formal Processes**
- G3: HCD cycle, feedback, simulation rules
- G4: Personas, accessibility, simplification

**G5-6: Structured Design**
- G5: Requirements, wireframes, variables/rules
- G6: Apply HCD principles, user research, simulation design

**G7-8: Evaluation & Communication**
- G7: Accessibility audits, harms, data-driven
- G8: Design briefs, XO critique, experiments

---

## No Issues Found ✓

1. **No Overly Broad Skills** - All well-scoped microsteps
2. **No True Duplicates** - Apparent overlaps are intentional progression
3. **No Grade-Inappropriate Skills** - All match expected modality
4. **No X-2 Violations** - Fixed in Phase 1

## Phase 2 Action Items

### Must Review (3 items)
1. G6-G8 dependencies on G1.01 and G1.02
2. G8 dependencies on T01.G6.01
3. G3 dependencies on T08 conditionals

### Should Review (3 items)
4. T04.G3.01 and T07.G3.01 dependencies
5. G7 standardized dependencies pattern
6. Simulation sub-topic consideration

### Nice to Have (2 items)
7. XO integration documentation (T05.G8.02)
8. CreatiCode implementation verification

---

## Recommendations

### Accept Current State ✓
Phase 1 optimizations successfully applied. Topic structure is sound.

### For Phase 2
1. **Priority 1:** Review and potentially replace G1 dependencies in G6-G8
2. **Priority 2:** Verify/remove T01.G6.01 dependencies in G8
3. **Priority 3:** Confirm T08 dependencies are necessary in G3

### Consider for Future
- Document simulation planning strand distinctly
- Create intermediate "reinforcement" versions of G1.01/G1.02 at higher grades
- Standardize cross-topic dependency patterns across all topics
