VIOLATIONS FIXED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Self-reference:
  T03.G2.04: Removed T03.G2.04

CRITICAL CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCIES ADDED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

T01 (algorithms):
  T01.G2.12: Choose directions that reach the goal
    Reason: Missing essential cross-topic prerequisites: events
      + T07.G1.01 (G1, events): Count repetitions in a pattern
      + T07.G1.02 (G1, events): Match "do N times" instructions to outcomes

T03 (variables):
  T03.G2.04: Recognize that related subtasks can be grouped as features
    Reason: Missing essential cross-topic prerequisites: sensing
      + T10.GK.01 (G0, sensing): Sort picture cards into groups
      + T10.GK.02 (G0, sensing): Count items in each group
