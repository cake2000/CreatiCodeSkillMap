# Grade 4 vs Grade 5 T06 Dependency Analysis Comparison

## Executive Summary

Both Grade 4 and Grade 5 skills were analyzed using identical criteria to determine which skills need T06 (Events & Sequences) dependencies added.

**Decision Criteria Applied Consistently:**
- **NEED T06:** Skills where students BUILD/IMPLEMENT executable code (loops, conditionals, variables, games, etc.)
- **DON'T NEED T06:** Skills focused on ANALYSIS/TRACING existing code or pure conceptual understanding

## Key Comparisons

### 1. Percentage Needing T06

| Grade | Skills Analyzed (without T06) | Need T06 Added | Percentage |
|-------|-------------------------------|----------------|------------|
| Grade 4 | 59 | 42 | 71.2% |
| Grade 5 | 78 | 47 | 60.3% |

**Interpretation:** Grade 4 has a higher percentage needing T06 because it focuses heavily on core programming topics (T07-T14) where most skills are implementation-based. Grade 5 includes more analysis, planning, and conceptual skills in specialized topics.

### 2. Topic Distribution

**Grade 4 - Concentrated in Core Programming:**
- 93% of skills needing T06 are in T07-T14 (core programming & games)
- Heavy emphasis on loops, conditionals, variables, lists, functions, and games

**Grade 5 - Distributed Across Specialized Topics:**
- 36% in core programming (T07-T12)
- 28% in games & graphics (T14-T20)
- 15% in data & AI (T25-T29)
- 28% in planning & design (T01-T05)
- 6% in cloud & ethics (T31, T36)

**Interpretation:** Grade 5 builds on Grade 4's programming foundation and extends into specialized application areas (data science, NLP, cloud, advanced game features), all requiring T06 for event handling.

### 3. Dependency Types

| Dependency | Grade 4 | Grade 5 | Total |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|
| T06.G3.01 (green flag) | 39 | 46 | 85 |
| T06.G3.02 (key press) | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| **Total** | **42** | **47** | **89** |

**Interpretation:** Both grades primarily use T06.G3.01 (green flag) as the foundational event. T06.G3.02 (key press) is used only for user-controlled interactions (player movement, jump controls).

### 4. Skills NOT Needing T06

**Grade 4 (17 skills):**
- T07-T13: Tracing, debugging, and analyzing existing code
- Focus: Reading and understanding code without writing it

**Grade 5 (31 skills):**
- T01-T02: Tracing algorithms and flowcharts
- T03-T05: Planning and design without implementation
- T04: Pattern recognition
- T24-T36: Conceptual understanding (AI practices, hardware, security, history, impacts)
- Focus: Analysis, planning, conceptual understanding, research

**Interpretation:** Grade 5 has more non-implementation skills because it includes broader CS topics (history, ethics, impacts) and more sophisticated planning/analysis tasks.

## Consistency of Criteria

The analysis applied the same decision criteria to both grades:

### Implementation Tasks (NEED T06):
- Students **build, create, implement, write** executable code
- Students **add functionality** to programs
- Students **use programming constructs** (loops, conditionals, variables) in working code
- Students create **games, simulations, visualizations**
- Students **configure systems** that execute code

### Analysis Tasks (DON'T NEED T06):
- Students **trace, read, analyze** existing code
- Students **recognize patterns** without coding
- Students **plan or design** without building
- Students **compare or evaluate** options
- Students engage in **conceptual understanding** or **research**

**Result:** The criteria were consistently applied, leading to clear categorization in both grades.

---

## Patterns Across Grades

### 1. Core Programming Topics (T07-T12)
**Grade 4:** Nearly all implementation skills need T06
**Grade 5:** Same pattern - implementation skills need T06, analysis skills don't

### 2. Games (T14)
**Grade 4:** All 14 game skills need T06 (projectiles, enemies, score, lives, levels, power-ups, pause, reset)
**Grade 5:** 6 out of 10 game skills need T06 (physics parameters, viewport, HUD, waves, high scores)
**Grade 5 exceptions:** Skills that are conceptual or planning-focused

### 3. Advanced Topics (T17-T36)
**Grade 4:** Not present or minimal
**Grade 5:** Mixed - implementation skills need T06 (physics, 3D, art, data, NLP, cloud), conceptual skills don't (security, history, impacts)

---

## Implications for Curriculum

### 1. T06 is Foundational for All Implementation
Both grades confirm that **T06 is a prerequisite for any skill where students write executable code.** Whether it's:
- Basic loops and conditionals (Grade 4)
- Advanced data science and NLP (Grade 5)
- Game mechanics and physics (both grades)
- Cloud persistence (Grade 5)

**Students need to know how to trigger scripts before they can build programs.**

### 2. Analysis Skills Don't Require T06
Both grades show that **tracing, debugging, and analyzing existing code** doesn't require T06 because:
- The code already exists and runs
- Students are reading/understanding, not writing
- No need to create event handlers

### 3. Grade Progression
- **Grade 4:** Focus on mastering core programming with events
- **Grade 5:** Apply event-driven programming to specialized domains

---

## Recommendations

### For Grade 4:
**Add T06 dependencies to 42 skills** as identified in the Grade 4 analysis.

### For Grade 5:
**Add T06 dependencies to 47 skills** as identified in the Grade 5 analysis.

### Verification Process:
1. Review the complete lists in:
   - `/media/binyu/USB2/dev/CreatiCodeSkillMap/t06_dependency_analysis.md` (Grade 4)
   - `/media/binyu/USB2/dev/CreatiCodeSkillMap/g5_t06_dependency_analysis.md` (Grade 5)
   - `/media/binyu/USB2/dev/CreatiCodeSkillMap/g5_t06_fixes_actionable.md` (Grade 5 quick reference)

2. Apply dependencies systematically using the actionable lists

3. Verify that:
   - All implementation skills have T06
   - No analysis/tracing skills have T06 added
   - The dependency type matches the skill type (green flag vs key press)

## Final Statistics

| Metric | Grade 4 | Grade 5 | Total |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Skills needing T06 added | 42 | 47 | 89 |
| Skills NOT needing T06 | 17 | 31 | 48 |
| Skills already have T06 | N/A | 94 | 94 |
| **Total skills analyzed** | **59** | **172** | **231** |

**Conclusion:** Both analyses are complete, consistent, and ready for implementation. The criteria distinguish clearly between implementation tasks (need T06) and analysis tasks (don't need T06).
