Skill: Spot a missing or wrong action
Description: Students watch a short picture story or animation and compare what happens to what was supposed to happen (e.g., the character should jump but doesn't, or moves the wrong direction). They point to the step that is missing or incorrect without needing to fix it yet.



ID: T13.GK.02
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Try again when the steps don't work
Description: Students follow a simple set of picture steps for a task (e.g., stacking blocks, moving a character on a board) and notice when the result is not what was intended. They experience the idea of "try, check, then try again" without needing to know how to change the steps themselves.

ID: T13.GK.03
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Fix a single wrong direction or action in steps
Description: Students "play computer" by acting out or watching a character follow a short list of picture steps to reach a fun goal (like a treasure or door). When the character ends up in the wrong place or does something silly, they identify which one movement is wrong (e.g., an arrow pointing left instead of right, or "sit down" too early) and swap it for a better step so the routine works.
