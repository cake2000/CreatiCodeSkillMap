## Description Quality Check

### ✅ All Descriptions Meet IXL Standards

**Criteria Met:**
- ✅ 2-3 sentences for each description
- ✅ Specific examples included
- ✅ Clear success criteria stated
- ✅ Student actions described (what students DO, not just learn)
- ✅ Context provided (why this matters, where it fits)

**Sample High-Quality Descriptions:**

**T05.G6.06:**
> "Students write 5-10 user stories using the format 'As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]' to capture what their app should do and why. They then prioritize stories into must-have versus nice-to-have categories, learning to focus on core functionality. This structured approach helps students translate user needs into concrete features."

**T13.G7.05:**
> "Students recruit 3-5 target users (matching their app's intended audience), have them test the app while completing structured tasks, collect feedback using a testing form (what worked, what confused them, what broke), document all bugs and suggestions in an organized list, and create a prioritized action plan for fixes. This teaches systematic user testing and iteration."

**T36.G8.06:**
> "Students prepare and deliver a 5-minute competition-style pitch including: compelling opening hook that grabs attention, clear problem statement with supporting evidence, live or video solution demonstration highlighting innovation, impact measurement showing how success will be evaluated, and Q&A preparation with anticipated tough questions (scalability, competition, technical challenges). They practice handling questions confidently and presenting under pressure with time limits."
