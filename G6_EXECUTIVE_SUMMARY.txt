GRADE 6 SKILLS ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Total Grade 6 skills analyzed: 166
Total issues found: 889
  - HIGH priority: 584 issues
  - MEDIUM priority: 299 issues
  - LOW priority: 6 issues

Skills are distributed across 36 topics (T01-T36)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. CRITICAL ISSUE: Excessive Dependencies on G3 and Lower Grades
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   - 584 HIGH priority issues identified
   - Almost ALL G6 skills depend on G3, G2, G1, or GK (Kindergarten) skills
   - This violates the fundamental rule: G6 should only depend on G4, G5, or G6

   Why this is a problem:
   - Skills from G3 and lower should be implicit knowledge by Grade 6
   - Listing them as dependencies creates unnecessary clutter
   - Makes the skill map harder to read and maintain
   - Students in G6 are assumed to have mastered all earlier grade content

   Most common problematic dependencies:
   - T01.GK.07: Find the pattern that repeats (Kindergarten)
   - T01.GK.08: Count how many times (Kindergarten)
   - T09.G3.01: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count
   - T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
   - T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
   - T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script

2. MEDIUM ISSUE: Transitive and Same-Topic Dependencies
   ------------------------------------------------------
   - 299 MEDIUM priority issues identified
   - Two types of problems:

     a) Transitive dependencies:
        - If skill A depends on B, and B depends on C, then A lists both B and C
        - A should only list B (C is automatically transitive)
        - This creates redundancy and complexity

     b) Same-topic earlier-grade dependencies:
        - G6 skills in a topic depending on G4 or G5 skills in the SAME topic
        - Example: T01.G6.01 depending on T01.G5.02
        - These should often be implicit since they're building on the same concept

3. LOW ISSUE: Overly Broad Skills
   -------------------------------
   - Only 6 skills identified as potentially too broad
   - This is actually GOOD - skills are generally well-defined and specific
   - The few flagged skills contain words like "multiple", "various", "comprehensive"

================================================================================
PATTERN ANALYSIS BY TOPIC
================================================================================

Topics with the MOST issues (top 10):

1. T01 – Everyday Algorithms: 8 skills, ~60+ issues
   - Heavy reliance on Kindergarten pattern recognition skills
   - Many dependencies on G3 scripting and variable skills

2. T14 – 2D Games: 6 skills, ~40+ issues
   - Complex dependencies on earlier grade game mechanics
   - Multiple transitive dependency chains

3. T17 – 2D Motion & Physics: 8 skills, ~50+ issues
   - Physics skills have deep dependency chains
   - Many G3 foundation dependencies that should be implicit

4. T02 – Algorithm Diagrams: 5 skills, ~40+ issues
   - Flowchart skills depend heavily on Kindergarten skills
   - Should assume diagram literacy from earlier grades

5. T03 – Problem Decomposition: 5 skills, ~40+ issues
   - Project planning skills over-reference basic decomposition from G1-G3

Other topics with similar patterns:
- T04 (Algorithm Patterns), T05 (Human-Centered Design)
- T07 (Loops), T09 (Variables), T11 (Functions)
- All follow the same issue: too many G3 and lower dependencies

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1: Clean Up G3 and Lower Dependencies (HIGH)
------------------------------------------------------
Action: Remove ALL dependencies on skills from G3, G2, G1, and GK

Rationale:
- By Grade 6, students have completed 6-7 years of the curriculum
- Basic skills like "count how many times" or "use a simple if" are foundational
- These should be assumed knowledge, not explicit dependencies

Impact:
- Will eliminate 584 HIGH priority issues
- Will make the skill map much cleaner and easier to read
- Will better align with the curriculum's progressive design

Example fixes:
  BEFORE: T01.G6.01 depends on [T01.G1.01, T01.GK.07, T01.GK.08, T04.G2.01]
  AFTER:  T01.G6.01 depends on [T01.G4.03, T01.G5.01] (only G4-G6 dependencies)

PRIORITY 2: Remove Transitive Dependencies (MEDIUM)
----------------------------------------------------
Action: Review dependency chains and remove redundant transitive dependencies

Process:
1. For each skill, identify its direct dependencies
2. Build the full dependency tree (including transitive)
3. Remove any dependency that is already covered transitively
4. Keep only the "minimum necessary" direct dependencies

Impact:
- Will eliminate many of the 299 MEDIUM priority issues
- Will simplify the dependency graph
- Will make it easier to understand what DIRECTLY requires what

Example:
  If A depends on B, and B depends on C:
  BEFORE: A depends on [B, C]
  AFTER:  A depends on [B] only

PRIORITY 3: Review Same-Topic Dependencies (MEDIUM)
----------------------------------------------------
Action: Carefully review dependencies on earlier grades within the same topic

Question to ask for each:
- Is this G4/G5 skill truly a prerequisite for this G6 skill?
- Or is it just "background knowledge" that should be implicit?

Guidelines:
- If the G6 skill is a direct extension/advancement: KEEP the dependency
- If the G6 skill is a related but separate concept: REMOVE the dependency
- If it's obvious progression (basic → intermediate → advanced): REMOVE

PRIORITY 4: No Action Needed for Broad Skills (LOW)
----------------------------------------------------
Action: Review the 6 flagged "broad" skills, but likely no changes needed

The skills are:
- Generally well-scoped and specific
- The few flagged are acceptable for their context
- This is a strength of the current curriculum

================================================================================
SKILLS WITH ZERO ISSUES (EXEMPLARS)
================================================================================

The following G6 skills have NO dependency issues and serve as good examples:

(Note: Most G6 skills with only G4-G6 dependencies or no dependencies at all)

Skills with clean dependency structure:
- Skills that only depend on G4, G5, or G6 skills
- Skills with no circular dependencies
- Skills with minimal transitive redundancy

These should be used as templates for fixing the others.

================================================================================
CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY CHECK
================================================================================

Result: NO CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES DETECTED

This is excellent news! The dependency graph is acyclic, which means:
- Skills can be learned in a clear progression
- No skill depends (directly or indirectly) on itself
- The curriculum has a proper hierarchical structure

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Generate a detailed fix list for all 584 HIGH priority issues
   - List each skill with dependencies to remove
   - Provide before/after comparison

2. Manually review MEDIUM priority issues
   - Some transitive dependencies may be intentional
   - Same-topic dependencies need case-by-case evaluation

3. Create an automated script to apply fixes
   - Parse the allskills.md file
   - Remove G3-and-lower dependencies
   - Generate updated skill entries

4. Validate the fixes
   - Ensure no skills become "orphaned" (no path from GK-G5)
   - Verify that the progression still makes sense
   - Test with sample learning paths

5. Document the dependency rules clearly
   - Grade N should only depend on grades N-2, N-1, or N
   - Earlier grade skills are assumed implicit knowledge
   - Cross-topic dependencies are allowed and encouraged

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The Grade 6 skills are well-designed and specific, but suffer from one major
issue: over-specification of dependencies on earlier grades (G3 and below).

This is easily fixable by applying a simple rule:
  "Grade 6 skills should only explicitly depend on G4, G5, or G6 skills"

Once fixed, the skill map will be:
- Cleaner and easier to read
- More maintainable
- Better aligned with the curriculum's progressive nature
- Still fully functional (implicit knowledge is still knowledge)

The lack of circular dependencies and the specificity of skills are major
strengths that should be preserved.
