- **Dependencies Added:** 38+
- **Dependencies Fixed:** 7 (including 2 CRITICAL grade-level errors)
- **Descriptions Clarified:** 15
- **Skills Broken Down:** 6 → 17 sub-skills

---

## Critical Fixes (Must Know)

### 1. Fixed Grade-Level Dependency Errors
**Problem:** T01.G2.16 and T01.G2.17 (Grade 2) depended on T06.G3.01 (Grade 3)
**Fixed:** Changed to appropriate Grade 2 dependencies
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Grade 2 can now be completed without Grade 3

### 2. Added Missing "Plan Before Implement" Dependency
**Problem:** T01.G4.02 (Implement plan) had no dependency on T01.G4.01 (Plan)
**Fixed:** Added T01.G4.01 as prerequisite
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Students now learn planning before implementation

### 3. Created Complete Dependency Chains
**Fixed 8 critical gaps:**
- G6.06 now depends on G6.05 (fairness)
- G7.02 now depends on G7.01 (patterns)
- G7.06 → G7.05 → G5.11 (edge cases)
- G7.07 now depends on G7.06 (failures)
- G8.02 now depends on G8.01 (simulations)
- G8.03 now depends on G8.02 (comparisons)
- G8.05 now depends on G8.04 (recursion)
- G8.07 now depends on G8.06 (fairness)

Split into 4 skills by construct:
1. Sequential
2. Conditionals
3. Loops
4. Variables

### 3. Variable Recognition (G4.06)
Split into 2 skills:
1. Identify variable names
2. Explain what they store

### 4. Script Comparison (G4.05)
Split into 2 skills:
1. Identify differences
2. Explain why one is better

### 5. Search Algorithms (G5.04)
Split into 2 skills:
1. "Find max" algorithm
2. "Count matches" algorithm

### 6. Algorithm Pseudocode (G7.03)
Split into 2 skills:
1. Search algorithm
2. Accumulation algorithm

## Top 15 Clarifications

1. **GK.08:** Simplified overly detailed description
2. **G2.11:** "small grid" → "3x3 or 4x4 grid"
3. **G3.01:** Added examples: "move forward twice, turn, say something"
4. **G3.03:** Added project examples: square drawing, dance, pattern
5. **G3.05:** "small script" → "10-15 blocks"
6. **G3.11:** "explain" → "describe goal and key actions"
7. **G4.01:** "5-8 steps" → "about 5-8 steps"
8. **G4.02:** "1-3 blocks" → "a few blocks"
9. **G4.03:** Added: "identify which sequences of 2-4 blocks repeat"
10. **G4.04:** Removed "nested patterns" (too advanced for G4)
11. **G4.07:** "5-10 iterations" → "several iterations"
12. **G4.09:** Added: "applies skills from G4.08 in game context"
13. **G5.05:** "all inputs" → "common and edge case inputs"
14. **G5.09:** Added: "informal explanation (not formal proof)"
15. **G6.01:** Added: "on sorted lists" and elimination method

## What's Different?

### Before Optimization:
- Some G2 skills couldn't be completed (depended on G3)
- Students jumped from simple to complex too quickly
- Missing logical dependencies (implement before plan)
- Vague descriptions ("simple", "small", "multi-step")
- 12 skills trying to teach multiple concepts at once

### After Optimization:
- All grade levels can be completed in sequence
- Gradual scaffolding with clear progression
- Complete dependency chains (identify → understand → apply)
- Concrete examples and specifications
- Each skill focuses on ONE clear learning objective
