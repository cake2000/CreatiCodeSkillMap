T07 (LOOPS) - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ✅ APPROVE WITH REQUIRED FIXES
Skill Quality: GOOD | Scaffolding: EXCELLENT | Issues: 32 (8 critical)

QUICK STATS
-----------
Total Skills:        41 (K through G8)
Gateway Skills:      5 (G3.01, G3.03, G3.04, G4.03, G6.09)
Unplugged Skills:    4 (K-G2)
Critical Issues:     8 (HIGH priority)
Medium Issues:       15
Low Issues:          9
Broken Dependencies: 2
Grade Load Peak:     G4 (8 skills - consider rebalancing)

CRITICAL FINDING
----------------
⚠️  Standard Scratch loop blocks (repeat N, forever, repeat until) are
    used in 10+ skills but NOT documented in blockdes8.txt.
    → IMMEDIATE ACTION: Verify blocks exist and add documentation

TOP 5 ISSUES TO FIX
-------------------
1. ❌ Document standard loop blocks (repeat, forever, repeat-until)
   Impact: 10+ skills, cannot verify feature alignment
   
2. ❌ T07.G3.04 broken dependency (T09.G3.02 doesn't exist)
   Fix: Change to T08.G3.01
   
3. ❌ T07.G3.01 overloaded with 5 dependencies (first loop skill!)
   Fix: Reduce to 2 core dependencies
   
4. ❌ T07.G4.03 mixes manual counters + for-loops in one skill
   Fix: Split into two separate skills
   
5. ❌ T07.G6.05/G6.06 unclear distinction (both trace nested loops)
   Fix: Merge or clearly differentiate

STRENGTHS
---------
✅ Excellent unplugged foundation (K-G2)
✅ Clear gateway skills for each loop type
✅ Strong nested loop progression (G4→G5→G6→G7)
✅ Competition-ready (trace tables, classic algorithms)
✅ Good use of CreatiCode enhanced blocks (for-loops, break/continue)
✅ No X-2 rule violations
✅ Proper intra-topic ordering

CONCERNS
--------
⚠️  Grade 4 has 8 skills (most of any grade)
⚠️  Some skills lack concrete examples (G5.01, G7.01)
⚠️  For-each loops taught in G6 but needed in G5
⚠️  Several unnecessary cross-topic dependencies
⚠️  Sensor references unclear (does CreatiCode support?)

AVAILABLE LOOP BLOCKS
---------------------
DOCUMENTED:
- for [v] from (start) to (limit) at step (s)
- repeat (N) times at intervals of (T)
- break
- continue  
- for each item [v] in [list]
- for each index [v] in [list]

UNDOCUMENTED (used in examples):
- repeat (N)           ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION
- forever              ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION
- repeat until <cond>  ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION

GRADE DISTRIBUTION
------------------
K:  1 skill   ✅ Appropriate
G1: 2 skills  ✅ Appropriate
G2: 1 skill   ✅ Appropriate
G3: 5 skills  ⚠️  Slightly aggressive (4 loop types + debug)
G4: 8 skills  ⚠️  HEAVY (consider moving 2 to G5)
G5: 4 skills  ✅ Appropriate
G6: 9 skills  ⚠️  Heavy but manageable
G7: 4 skills  ✅ Appropriate
G8: 7 skills  ✅ Appropriate

RECOMMENDED REBALANCING
-----------------------
Move G4.07 (trace nested) to G5  → Needs more maturity
Move G4.08 (timed repeat) to G5  → Specific feature
Move G6.09 (for-each) to G5      → Needed earlier for lists

Result: G4=6, G5=7, G6=8 (more balanced)

COMPETITION READINESS
---------------------
Bebras Challenge:     ✅ STRONG (pattern recognition, loop counting)
USACO Bronze:         ✅ STRONG (complete search, nested loops, simulation)
Code.org CSA:         ✅ STRONG (for-loop variants, list iteration)
Loop Invariants:      ⚠️  Not covered (optional college-level topic)

ACTION PLAN
-----------
WEEK 1 (Critical):
□ Verify standard loop blocks exist in CreatiCode
□ Add loop blocks to blockdes8.txt
□ Fix T07.G3.04 broken dependency
□ Simplify T07.G3.01 to 2 dependencies
□ Split T07.G4.03 into manual + for-loop skills
□ Clarify G6.01, G6.05/G6.06
□ Fix or remove T07.G8.02

WEEK 2 (Important):
□ Remove unnecessary dependencies (G3.05, G4.01, G4.02, G4.04)
□ Add missing G6.04 → G6.08 dependency
□ Move G6.09 to G5
□ Verify sensor support for G5.02
□ Standardize G8 sub-skill dependencies

WEEK 3 (Enhancement):
□ Add concrete examples to vague skills
□ Consider new scaffolding skills (counter init, loop patterns)
□ Review G4 workload (move 1-2 to G5)
□ Create teacher guide for loop progression

ESTIMATED EFFORT
----------------
HIGH priority fixes:    8-12 hours
MEDIUM improvements:   12-16 hours
LOW enhancements:       4-6 hours
Total:                24-34 hours

APPROVAL STATUS
---------------
✅ APPROVE for implementation AFTER fixing 8 HIGH priority issues
⏸️  HOLD on G3-G4 deployment until standard blocks verified
📋 RECOMMEND reviewing G4 workload before rollout
