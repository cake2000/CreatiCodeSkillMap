### 2. Progressive Integration
- Grades 1-2: Minimal dependencies (exploration)
- Grade 3: First major integration (6+ deps avg)
- Grades 4-8: Steady increase to 10+ deps avg

### 3. Capstone Concentration
74% of skills are capstones, with concentration in Grades 3-8. This provides excellent assessment opportunities at every level.

### 4. Cross-Topic Synergy
Four distinct clusters with clear shared patterns enable:
- Sequential topic introduction
- Cross-topic integrated projects
- Natural progression paths

### 5. AI Topics Require Ethics
T21-T24 (AI topics) all depend on T05 (Human-Centered Design) for ethical considerations, demonstrating responsible AI education.

## Recommendations

### For Curriculum Design

1. **Ensure T06-T13 Mastery First**
   - Applications heavily depend on programming core
   - Students need solid foundation before application topics

2. **Cluster-Based Introduction**
   - Introduce topics in logical clusters (Games → Media → Interface → AI)
   - Build cross-topic connections explicitly

3. **Leverage Capstone Skills**
   - Use 256 identified capstones for end-of-unit assessments
   - Design rubrics around dependency integration

4. **Cross-Topic Projects**
   - Create projects combining clusters (e.g., AI + Games, Media + Interface)
   - Use pattern analysis to identify natural combinations

### For Teaching Sequence

**Elementary (Grades 3-5):**
- Simple applications with clear dependencies
- Focus on single-cluster projects
- Introduction to integration

**Middle School (Grades 6-8):**
- Cross-cluster integration projects
- AI topics with ethical considerations
- Meta-level skills (T24 XO)

### For Assessment

1. **Use Capstone Skills**
   - 256 capstones provide assessment opportunities
   - Focus on integration, not isolated skills

2. **Project-Based Evaluation**
   - Capstones naturally suit project assessment
   - Rubrics should address dependency integration

3. **Progressive Complexity**
   - G3-4: Simple capstones (5-8 deps)
   - G5-6: Moderate capstones (8-11 deps)
   - G7-8: Complex capstones (10-14 deps)
