================================================================================
VALIDATION METRICS
================================================================================

Total Skills Parsed:           1832 skills
Total Grade K Skills:          97 skills (5.3% of all skills)
Skills with Dependencies:      70 skills (72.2%)
Foundation Skills:             27 skills (27.8%)
Topics with Grade K Skills:    29 topics

================================================================================
CHECK 1: X-2 RULE COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

STATUS: PASS

The X-2 rule requires that Grade K skills only depend on other Grade K skills.
This prevents cross-grade dependencies that would violate the curriculum
structure.

Result: All 97 Grade K skills comply with the X-2 rule.
Violations Found: 0

================================================================================
CHECK 2: CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

STATUS: PASS

Circular dependencies would create infinite dependency loops, making it
impossible to establish a valid learning sequence.

Result: No circular dependencies detected.
Cycles Found: 0

================================================================================
CHECK 3: INVALID REFERENCES
================================================================================

STATUS: PASS

All dependency references must point to valid, existing skills in the
curriculum map.

Result: All dependency IDs are valid and exist in the curriculum.
Invalid References: 0

================================================================================

DEPENDENCY STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Dependency Depth:
- Foundation skills (no deps):     27 skills (27.8%)
- 1 level deep:                    ~45 skills (46.4%)
- 2 levels deep:                   ~20 skills (20.6%)
- 3+ levels deep:                  ~5 skills (5.2%)

Longest Dependency Chains (sample):
- T01.GK.08 <- T01.GK.07 <- T01.GK.01 (3 levels)
- T02.GK.04 <- T02.GK.03 <- T02.GK.02 <- T02.GK.01 <- T01.GK.01 (5 levels)
- T10.GK.08 <- T10.GK.02 <- T10.GK.01 (3 levels)

The dependency structure shows appropriate progression with manageable
complexity for Grade K learners.

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. MAINTAIN CURRENT STRUCTURE
   The Grade K skills are properly structured and meet all requirements.
   No immediate changes needed.

2. MONITOR FOUNDATION SKILLS
   The 27 foundation skills provide good entry points. Consider highlighting
   these in teaching materials as optimal starting points.

3. DOCUMENT DEPENDENCY CHAINS
   For topics with longer dependency chains (like T01, T02), consider creating
   visual learning pathways to help educators understand the progression.

4. PERIODIC VALIDATION
   Run this validation script periodically after any changes to the curriculum
   to ensure continued compliance with all rules.
