## ISSUE ANALYSIS

### HIGH Priority Issues (Must Fix)

#### H1: Dependency on wrong skill ID (T02.G4.05 instead of T02.G4.06)
- **Skill**: T02.G5.05 (Write pseudocode for a loop‑based algorithm)
- **Current dependency**: T02.G4.05 (Trace a flowchart that includes a loop structure)
- **Should be**: T02.G4.06 (Convert a story description into simple pseudocode)
- **Reason**: T02.G5.05 is about writing pseudocode, so it should depend on the earlier pseudocode skill (T02.G4.06), not a flowchart tracing skill (T02.G4.05). The description even says "using clear indentation and step labels learned from earlier T02 grades" which aligns with T02.G4.06.
- **Recommendation**: Change dependency from T02.G4.05 to T02.G4.06

#### H2: Non-standard skill ID format
- **Skill**: T02.G5.02.01 (Design a flowchart with input/output symbols for a calculator task)
- **Issue**: Uses a three-level ID (G5.02.01) instead of the standard two-level format (GX.YY)
- **Impact**: Breaks the skill ID convention and may cause system issues
- **Recommendation**: Renumber this skill to T02.G5.07 or merge it into an existing skill

#### H3: Odd skill ID format
- **Skill**: T02.G7.03.01 (Convert a search algorithm flowchart to pseudocode)
- **Issue**: Same as H2 - uses three-level ID (G7.03.01) instead of standard format
- **Impact**: Inconsistent with skill numbering system
- **Recommendation**: Renumber to T02.G7.07 or similar

---

### MEDIUM Priority Issues (Should Fix)

#### M1: K-2 skills need to be picture-based or unplugged (currently appropriate)
- **Status**: GOOD - All K-2 skills are appropriately picture-based and unplugged
- K skills focus on picture sequences
- Grade 1 skills focus on picture algorithms
- Grade 2 skills transition to labeled boxes but still picture-focused
- No issues found

#### M2: Grade 3+ skills should involve block-based coding (needs review)
- **Issue**: Grade 3-8 skills focus heavily on flowcharts and pseudocode, but connection to actual block-based coding is limited
- **Skills with good coding connection**:
  - T02.G3.06: Match a simple flowchart to a script
  - T02.G3.07: Match a decision flowchart to if/else code
  - T02.G6.05: Match pseudocode to code with loops and conditions
- **Skills lacking coding practice**:
  - Most flowchart creation skills (T02.G3.02, T02.G4.02, T02.G5.02, etc.) only mention creating diagrams, not implementing them in code
- **Recommendation**: Add more skills that bridge from diagrams to actual code implementation

#### M3: Scaffolding gap between diagram types
- **Issue**: Jump from "box diagrams" (G2) to formal "flowcharts" (G3) might be too steep
- **Current progression**: Pictures → Labeled boxes → Flowcharts
- **Gap**: Students go from informal box diagrams to formal flowchart symbols in one grade
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding intermediate skill in G2 or early G3 that introduces flowchart symbols informally

#### M4: Trace table introduction could be smoother
- **Issue**: Trace tables appear suddenly in G4.08
- **Current**: T02.G4.08 introduces trace tables with minimal scaffolding
- **Progression**: T02.G4.08 (fill in trace table) → T02.G5.03 (trace with state tracking) → T02.G5.04 (create own format)
- **Gap**: No skill teaches what a trace table is or why it's useful
- **Recommendation**: Add a skill in G4 (before .08) that introduces trace tables conceptually

#### M5: Algorithm comparison skills could build earlier
- **Issue**: Algorithm comparison appears late (G5.06, G6.03, G7.05)
- **Current first appearance**: T02.G5.06 (Grade 5)
- **Opportunity**: Simple algorithm comparison could happen earlier
- **Recommendation**: Add basic comparison skill in G3 or G4 (e.g., "which path is shorter?" for simple flowcharts)

---

### LOW Priority Issues (Optional Improvements)

#### L1: Skill descriptions could be more concise
- **Examples**:
  - T02.G3.01 description is quite long and explains flowchart symbols in detail
  - T02.G8.03 has a very long description
- **Recommendation**: Consider moving detailed symbol explanations to implementation notes
- **Priority**: Low - descriptions are accurate and helpful, just verbose

#### L2: Some skills might be too similar
- **T02.G1.02** (Add a missing step) vs **T02.G1.05** (Fix one wrong step)
  - Both involve fixing a single element in a picture algorithm
  - Difference is subtle (missing vs wrong)
  - Could potentially be combined into one skill with both types of fixes
- **T02.G2.03** (Trace linear sequence) vs **T02.G2.04** (Track changes step-by-step)
  - Both involve tracing instruction sequences
  - T02.G2.04 adds "reveal one at a time" but concept is very similar
  - Consider: Are these different enough to warrant separate skills?
- **Priority**: Low - having granular skills isn't necessarily bad for assessment

#### L3: Pseudocode pathway could be clearer
- **Current pseudocode skills**:
  - G4.06: Convert story to simple pseudocode
  - G4.07: Match pseudocode to flowchart
  - G5.05: Write pseudocode for loop-based algorithm
  - G6.04: Convert flowchart to pseudocode
  - G7.03.01: Convert search algorithm flowchart to pseudocode
  - G8.01: Write pseudocode for non-trivial algorithm
  - G8.02: Trace your pseudocode with test cases
- **Issue**: Pathway zigzags between writing pseudocode and converting diagrams
- **Recommendation**: Consider restructuring to have clearer "write" vs "convert" tracks
- **Priority**: Low - current structure works, but could be more elegant

#### L4: More real-world applications at higher grades
- **Current real-world skills**:
  - T02.G8.04: Design flowchart for real-world decision
- **Opportunity**: Add more real-world applications throughout G6-G8
- **Examples**:
  - G6: Flowchart for a recipe or craft project
  - G7: Algorithm for organizing/scheduling tasks
  - G8: More decision trees for actual scenarios
- **Priority**: Low - current skills are solid, this would enhance engagement

#### L5: Limited debugging/error-finding skills
- **Current debugging skills**:
  - T02.G1.04: Find a broken picture algorithm
  - T02.G1.05: Fix one wrong step in picture algorithm
  - T02.G7.06: Trace algorithm to find a bug or edge case
- **Gap**: No debugging skills in G2-G6
- **Recommendation**: Add debugging/error-finding skills in middle grades
- **Priority**: Low - error-finding is covered in other topics (T01)

## DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS (Within T02 Only)

### Dependency Violations - X-2 Rule

**No violations found** - All T02-to-T02 dependencies follow the X-2 rule:
- Dependencies are only to skills in the same grade (X), previous grade (X-1), or two grades back (X-2)
- Maximum dependency gap found: 2 grades (which is allowed)

Examples of proper dependencies:
- T02.G3.01 → T02.G2.02 (G3 → G2, gap of 1: OK)
- T02.G4.04 → T02.G3.04 (G4 → G3, gap of 1: OK)
- T02.G5.01 → T02.G4.04 (G5 → G4, gap of 1: OK)

### Unnecessary Same-Grade Dependencies

**None found** - All same-grade dependencies appear necessary for proper sequencing within the grade level.

Examples of necessary same-grade dependencies:
- T02.GK.04 depends on both T02.GK.02 and T02.GK.03 (builds on both skills)
- T02.G3.04 depends on T02.G3.03 (must understand decision diamonds before tracing them)
- T02.G4.07 depends on T02.G4.06 (must convert to pseudocode before matching it)

### Skills Depending on Later Skills

**None found** - All dependencies point backward or to earlier grades, as expected.

### Circular Dependencies

**None found** - Dependency graph is acyclic.

## DEPENDENCY GRAPH NOTES

The T02 topic has a relatively clean dependency structure:
- Linear progression through grade levels
- Most skills depend on 1-2 prerequisite skills
- Multiple pathways converge at higher grades:
  - Flowchart pathway (GK → G1 → G2 → G3 → G4 → G5 → G6 → G7 → G8)
  - Pseudocode pathway (G4 → G5 → G6 → G7 → G8)
  - Trace table pathway (G4 → G5 → G6 → G7)
- No complex branching or reconvergence patterns
- Clean separation between "create" skills and "analyze" skills

The topic is well-structured overall with only minor issues to address.
