## Dependency Patterns

The most common cross-topic dependencies added were:

1. **T09.G3.03** (Basic conditional logic) - Added to 43 skills
   - Essential prerequisite for understanding conditional logic in Grade 5 skills

2. **T10.G3.05 & T10.G4.18** (Loop structures from Lists & Tables) - Added together to 20 skills
   - Critical for understanding nested loops and iteration patterns

3. **T12.G3.05 & T12.G4.05** (Procedures from Organizing Programs) - Added together to 29 skills
   - Required for understanding custom blocks and procedures

## Handling of Split Skills

The script successfully handled skills that have been split into sub-skills:
- When a parent skill like `T01.G5.02` was in the recommendation list, all sub-skills (e.g., `T01.G5.02.01.01`, `T01.G5.02.01.02`, etc.) received the same dependencies
- This ensures consistency across related sub-skills

## Verification

Sample verifications performed:
- ✓ T01.G5.09: Confirmed T10.G3.05 and T10.G4.18 added
- ✓ T11.G5.01: Confirmed T12.G3.05 and T12.G4.05 added
- ✓ T22.G5.05: Confirmed T12.G3.05, T09.G3.03, and T12.G4.05 added
- ✓ All sub-skills of T01.G5.02: Confirmed all 3 dependencies added
- ✓ File format: Dependencies maintained proper format with `* SkillID` notation

## Issues Encountered

**None.** All recommended dependency additions were successfully applied.

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Review Required:** The circular dependencies section in GRADE5_DEPENDENCY_REPORT.md was NOT addressed (as per instructions)
2. **Testing:** Run dependency validation to ensure no circular dependencies were introduced
3. **Commit Changes:** Commit the updated allskills.md with appropriate message
4. **Consider:** Review potentially redundant dependencies section from the report
