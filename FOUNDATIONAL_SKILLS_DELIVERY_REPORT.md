### 2. IXL-Quality Specifications

Each skill follows proven IXL model:
- One clear learning objective
- Concrete, auto-gradable outcome
- 15-30 minute completion time
- Immediate feedback
- Scaffolded progression

**Result:** Proven engagement and mastery model.

### 3. Complete Teaching Support

Not just "what to teach" but "how to teach it":
- Step-by-step instructions
- Common errors anticipated
- Hints and solutions provided
- Sample lesson plans

### 4. Auto-Grading Ready

Every skill includes:
- Structure checks (block presence, connections)
- Runtime checks (behavior, outcomes)
- Clear pass/fail criteria

**Result:** Scalable assessment, immediate feedback.

### 5. Differentiation Built-In

Strategies for:
- Struggling students (break down further)
- Advanced students (extension challenges)
- ELL students (visual supports)
- Special needs (multiple modalities)

**Result:** All students can succeed.

### 6. Week 3 Integration

Culminates with:
