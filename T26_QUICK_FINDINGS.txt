T26 (Data Collection & Logging) - Quick Findings
================================================
Date: 2024-11-24

SKILLS ANALYZED: 53 total (K-G8)
- Kindergarten: 3 (100% unplugged)
- Grade 1: 3 (100% unplugged)
- Grade 2: 5 (100% unplugged)
- Grade 3: 6 (1 unplugged, 5 coding)
- Grade 4: 7 (2 unplugged, 5 coding)
- Grade 5: 12 (all coding)
- Grade 6: 11 (all coding)
- Grade 7: 7 (all coding)
- Grade 8: 5 (3 coding, 1 conceptual, 1 project)

CREATICODE SUPPORT: 91% fully supported
- 48 skills: Full support
- 3 skills: Need verification (table export, Google Sheets)
- 2 skills: N/A (unplugged)
- 0 skills: Unsupported

X-2 RULE: ✅ No violations found

CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix):
1. T26.G3.04 - Too broad (raw vs summary data)
   → Break into 4 sub-skills

2. T26.G4.02 - Too broad (tables for logging)
   → Break into 4 sub-skills

3. T26.G5.02 - Too broad (sampling strategies)
   → Break into 4 sub-skills

4. T26.G5.08.02 - Verify table export/import blocks exist

5. T26.G6.05 - DUPLICATE of T26.G5.05.01
   → Remove or significantly differentiate

6. T26.G6.01.01 - NAMING ERROR (should be T26.G6.06.02)
   → Renumber to group with filter skills

MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES:
7. T26.G6.07 - Verify Google Sheets import blocks
8. T26.G6.08 - Verify Google Sheets export blocks
9. T26.G6.09 - Too broad (multiplayer logging)
   → Break into 4 sub-skills
10. T26.G7.06 - Verify Google Sheets update blocks

LOW PRIORITY ISSUES:
11. T26.G8.01.01 - Mark as "Capstone Project: 3-4 weeks"
12. T26.G8.05 - Mark as "Advanced/Optional" (semantic databases)

CREATICODE FEATURES TO VERIFY:
- data_exporttable / data_importtable (for T26.G5.08.02)
- Google Sheets blocks (for T26.G6.07, T26.G6.08, T26.G7.06):
  - p2p_readfromgooglesheet
  - p2p_writeintogooglesheet
  - append row to Google Sheet
  - set value in Google Sheet cell

EXCELLENT PROGRESSIONS:
✅ Survey complexity: binary → 3 options → 4+ options → coded
✅ Data structures: lists → tables → databases
✅ Sensors: 1 sensor → 2 sensors → 3 sensors
✅ Database: insert/fetch → query/filter → update/delete → pipelines
✅ Ethics: consent → privacy → provenance → bias → agreements

MISSING SCAFFOLDING (Optional):
- G3: Unplugged "design a data table" activity
- G4: Conceptual "client vs server storage"
- G5: Ethics "data minimization techniques"

OVERALL GRADE: A- (Strong with fixable issues)

ESTIMATED FIX TIME: 2-3 days

ACTION ITEMS:
1. Break down 4 broad skills into sub-skills
2. Verify 2 block types exist in CreatiCode
3. Remove duplicate skill (T26.G6.05)
4. Fix naming issue (T26.G6.01.01)
5. Add metadata markers (capstone, advanced)
6. Create rubrics for project skills
