T26 DATA COLLECTION & LOGGING - QUICK FINDINGS
Date: 2024-11-24
Total Skills: 66

=== CRITICAL ISSUES ===

1. PHANTOM SKILL DEPENDENCY (HIGH)
   Problem: "T26.G4.02: Use tables to log multi-attribute events" DOESN'T EXIST
   Referenced by:
   - T26.G4.06 (line ~18612)
   - T26.G5.01 (line ~18626)
   
   Reality: Two skills exist:
   - T26.G4.02.01: Create basic tables for logging
   - T26.G4.02.02: Log structured events with multiple attributes
   
   FIX: Replace all "T26.G4.02" with "T26.G4.02.02"

2. WRONG SKILL ID (MEDIUM)
   T26.G6.01.01: Build compound database conditions with AND/OR
   Current ID suggests sub-skill of T26.G6.01 (Map stakeholder questions)
   Content is about database filters, not stakeholder mapping
   
   FIX: Renumber to T26.G6.06.01.01
   Update dependencies in: T26.G6.06.02, T26.G7.07.01, T26.G7.07.02

3. TOO BROAD SKILLS (MEDIUM)
   T26.G8.01: Design end-to-end telemetry pipelines
   - Covers 6 distinct pipeline stages
   - Should split into 7 sub-skills (6 stages + 1 synthesis)
   
   T26.G8.01.01: Implement end-to-end telemetry pipeline
   - ID conflicts with recommended T26.G8.01 breakdown
   - Implementation is also too broad
   - FIX: Renumber to T26.G8.01.08 or T26.G8.02.01

=== BLOCK VERIFICATION ISSUES ===

4. GOOGLE SHEETS (LOW)
   T26.G6.07 & T26.G6.08 list "set Google Sheets credentials"
   This block DOESN'T EXIST
   URL is passed directly to read/write blocks
   FIX: Remove from block lists

5. PRINT BLOCK NAMING (LOW)
   T26.G5.01 & T26.G7.05 list "print to console"
   Actual block: "print [MESSAGE] in [console v] color [COLOR]"
   DECISION NEEDED: Simplified names OK or use exact syntax?

6. TABLE COLUMN NAMES (LOW)
   T26.G5.04.01 lists "set column names" block
   NEEDS VERIFICATION: Check CreatiCode table initialization

=== STRENGTHS ===

✓ All 11 K-2 skills are appropriate unplugged activities
✓ All 55 G3-8 skills are block-based coding
✓ NO X-2 rule violations
✓ NO circular dependencies  
✓ NO forward references within T26
✓ Excellent privacy/ethics integration (5 skills K-8)
✓ Strong scaffolding from lists → tables → databases
✓ Real-world applications (leaderboards, multiplayer, pipelines)
✓ 95% blocks verified against blockdes8.txt

=== STATISTICS ===

Skills by Grade:
- K: 3 skills (unplugged)
- 1: 3 skills (unplugged)
- 2: 5 skills (unplugged)
- 3: 11 skills (first coding, lists)
- 4: 8 skills (tables, file I/O)
- 5: 14 skills (database intro, leaderboards)
- 6: 14 skills (database queries, Google Sheets)
- 7: 7 skills (custom blocks, updates/deletes)
- 8: 5 skills (pipelines, semantic search)

Dependencies:
- Internal T26: 77 dependencies (all valid)
- External topics: 77 dependencies (all appropriate)
- Phantom: 1 (T26.G4.02)

=== ACTION ITEMS ===

IMMEDIATE (Do First):
1. Find-replace: "T26.G4.02" → "T26.G4.02.02" in dependencies
2. Renumber T26.G6.01.01 → T26.G6.06.01.01
3. Update 3 dependencies referencing T26.G6.01.01

SECONDARY (Do Next):
4. Split T26.G8.01 into 7 sub-skills
5. Renumber T26.G8.01.01 to avoid conflict
6. Remove "set Google Sheets credentials" from T26.G6.07 & T26.G6.08
7. Add specific widget blocks to T26.G6.03 description

VERIFY:
8. Check "set column names" block mechanism (T26.G5.04.01)
9. Decide on block naming convention (simplified OK?)

=== OVERALL ASSESSMENT ===

Quality: 8.5/10 → 9.5/10 after fixes

Well-structured topic with strong progression and real-world applications.
Main issues are 1 phantom dependency and 2 overly broad G8 skills.
All other aspects (dependencies, grade appropriateness, platform support) excellent.
