# T06 Dependency Analysis for Grade 5 Skills

## Executive Summary

Analyzed 172 Grade 5 skills to identify which need T06 (Events & Sequences) dependencies added.

**Current Status:**
- **94 skills** already have T06 dependencies
- **47 skills** need T06 added (List A) - THESE NEED FIXING
- **31 skills** do NOT need T06 (List B)

**Rationale:** Following the same criteria used for Grade 4 - T06 teaches foundational event handling (green flag, key press, sprite click) which is essential for writing any executable code. Skills that involve building or implementing programs need T06 as a prerequisite. Skills focused purely on analysis, tracing, or debugging existing code do not require T06.

### Dependency Distribution

- **46 skills** should add `T06.G3.01` (Build a green-flag script)
- **1 skill** should add `T06.G3.02` (Build a key-press script):
  - T14.G5.02 (Control jump timing)

---

## Rationale for Decision Criteria

### Skills Requiring T06
Programming skills where students:
- **Build or create** new programs, features, or systems
- **Implement or use** programming constructs in executable code
- **Write scripts** that need event triggers to run
- Work with **game mechanics** (physics, spawning, HUD)
- Create **simulations** or **data visualizations**
- Add **functionality** to existing projects
- **Configure** or **modify** executable systems

### Skills NOT Requiring T06
Analysis and comprehension skills where students:
- **Trace or read** existing code without modification
- **Analyze or compare** algorithms or programs
- **Recognize patterns** in existing code
- **Plan or design** without implementation
- Focus on **conceptual understanding** (networking, security concepts)
- **Research** historical or social topics
- Make **decisions** about design approaches without coding

## Comparison with Grade 4

**Grade 4 Analysis Results:**
- 42 skills needed T06 added (out of 59 analyzed)
- Focused heavily on T07-T14 (core programming topics)

**Grade 5 Analysis Results:**
- 47 skills need T06 added (out of 78 without T06)
- More distributed across topics including data science (T25-T29), cloud (T31), and advanced topics
- Grade 5 has more implementation-heavy skills in specialized areas

**Key Observation:** Grade 5 builds on Grade 4's programming foundations and extends into more specialized application areas (data science, NLP, cloud computing, advanced game features), all of which still require T06 as a foundation for triggering scripts.

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with adding T06 dependencies to the 47 skills identified in List A.** This ensures students have foundational event-handling knowledge before:

1. Building programs with loops, conditionals, variables, and functions
2. Creating games with physics, spawning, and HUD systems
3. Implementing data science and simulation projects
4. Building text processing and NLP features
5. Working with cloud persistence and multi-session features
6. Creating any interactive or executable system

The distinction between "implement" vs "analyze" remains clear and consistent with Grade 4 criteria.
