## CreatiCode Loop Features Verified

**Standard Blocks:**
- `repeat (N)` - counted loop
- `forever` - infinite loop
- `repeat until <condition>` - conditional loop

**CreatiCode-Specific Blocks:**
- `for [variable] from (START) to (LIMIT) at step (S)` - advanced for-loop ✅
- `repeat (N) times at intervals of (T)` - timed loop for animations ✅
- `break` - exit loop early ✅
- `continue` - skip to next iteration ✅
- `for each item [var] in [list]` - iterate through list values ✅
- `for each index [var] in [list]` - iterate through list indices ✅

**Verification Result**: All CreatiCode-specific loop blocks are accurately described in T07 skills.

---

## Changes Made

### ONLY Change: T07.G6.05 Wording Improvement

**Skill**: T07.G6.05 - Trace nested loops using a trace table

**Change Type**: Minor wording improvement (active voice alignment)

**Before**:
> "Students learn the trace table technique as a systematic method for tracking variable changes through nested loops..."

**After**:
> "Students use the trace table technique as a systematic method for tracking variable changes through nested loops..."

**Rationale**:
- Better alignment with IXL-style action verbs
- More assessable language ("use" vs "learn")
- Improves clarity and consistency with other skill descriptions

**Impact**:
- Risk Level: Minimal (single word change)
- Dependencies Affected: 0
- Time Required: 2 minutes

## Issues Considered and Rejected for Phase 1

### Medium Priority Issue #1: Split T07.G4.03 (Manual Counters vs For-Loops)

**Decision**: REJECTED for Phase 1

**Current Skill**: T07.G4.03 covers both manual counter variables AND CreatiCode's for-loop block in a single skill.

**Rationale for Rejection**:
1. **Conceptual Unity**: Manual counters and for-loops represent the SAME concept with different implementations
2. **Pedagogical Efficiency**: Teaching both together helps students understand that for-loops automate the manual counter pattern
3. **Dependency Impact**: 4 skills depend on T07.G4.03; splitting would require reviewing all dependencies
4. **Current Excellence**: T07 rated "exemplary" - don't fix what isn't broken in Phase 1
5. **Phase 1 Focus**: Only critical issues should be addressed

**Future Consideration**: Can revisit in Phase 2 if assessment data shows students struggling with one pattern but not the other.

### Low Priority Issue #2: Grade 5 Balance (4 skills vs 8-9 in G4/G6)

**Decision**: REJECTED for Phase 1

**Current State**: G5 has 4 skills while G4 has 8 and G6 has 9.

**Rationale for Rejection**:
1. **Intentional Design**: G5 serves as APPLICATION year, not MECHANICS year
   - G4: Learn loop mechanics (8 skills covering different types/patterns)
   - G5: Apply loops to real problems (4 focused application skills)
   - G6: Advanced techniques (9 skills for complex patterns)
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: The 4 G5 skills cover diverse, important applications:
   - T07.G5.01: Probability/simulation (STEM integration)
   - T07.G5.02: Data structures foundation (critical for G6+)
   - T07.G5.03: Mathematical computation (practical skill)
   - T07.G5.04: Nested loops (major conceptual leap)
3. **Strong Scaffolding**: Each G5 skill is a prerequisite for multiple G6 skills
4. **Cognitive Load**: G5.04 (nested loops) is already a major leap; adding more could overwhelm

**Future Consideration**: Can add enrichment skills in Phase 2:
   - T07.G5.05: Interactive loops with user input
   - T07.G5.06: Trace loops modifying lists

1. K: Complete patterns (recognize repetition)
2. G1: Count repetitions + match instructions to outcomes
3. G2: Identify when to use repetition vs single actions

**Bridge to G3**: T07.G3.01 correctly depends on T07.G2.01, ensuring students understand WHEN to use loops before learning HOW to code them.

### G3 Gateway: ✅ Strong Foundation
**T07.G3.01 Dependencies** (properly designed):
- T06.G3.01: Basic scripting (cross-topic)
- T04.G1.01: Pattern recognition (cross-topic)
- T04.G2.01: Repeating units (cross-topic)
- T01.G2.05: If/then algorithms (cross-topic)
- **T07.G2.01: When to use repeat** (intra-topic foundation)

### Progression Path: ✅ Natural Flow
1. **G3**: Basic loops (repeat, forever, repeat-until)
2. **G4**: Combine with conditionals, variables, counters
3. **G5**: Apply to real problems (data, probability)
4. **G6**: Optimization techniques (trace tables, refactoring, search)
5. **G7**: Efficiency and STEM integration
6. **G8**: Algorithm design and analysis

## Recommendations for Phase 2

While T07 is exemplary for Phase 1, consider these enhancements for Phase 2:

### Medium Priority
1. **Split T07.G4.03** into manual counters + for-loops IF assessment data shows:
   - Students master one pattern but struggle with the other
   - Need for separate practice/assessment
   - Split would be: T07.G4.03 (manual) + T07.G4.03.01 (for-loops)

### Low Priority
2. **Expand G5 Skills** by adding 1-2 application skills IF:
   - Students show readiness for more G5 content
   - Want smoother transition from G4 (8 skills) to G6 (9 skills)
   - Suggested additions:
     - T07.G5.05: Interactive loops with user input (bridges T07 + T10)
     - T07.G5.06: Trace loops modifying lists (bridges G5.02 and G6.03)

### Inter-Topic Dependencies
3. **Review cross-topic dependencies** in Phase 2:
   - Verify all dependencies to T06, T08, T09 are still optimal
   - Check for missing dependencies that could improve scaffolding
   - Ensure proper integration with other topics
