================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

PROBLEMATIC SKILLS IDENTIFIED:
- 3 TOO ADVANCED (require AP/college knowledge)
- 22 BORDERLINE (need simplification or scaffolding)
- 5 TERMINOLOGY ISSUES (content fine, terms intimidating)

THREE-TRACK SOLUTION:
- 📘 Standard: 270 skills (core curriculum for all)
- ⭐ Enrichment: 20 skills (advanced but age-appropriate)
- 🏆 Competition: 4 skills (ACSL, Olympiad prep)

================================================================================
CRITICAL SKILL REVISIONS (HIGH PRIORITY)
================================================================================

1. T10.G8.02 - Sorting Algorithm Implementation
   ISSUE: AP Computer Science A content
   ACTION: Move to competition, create standard alternative
   
2. T27.G8.02 - Causal Relationships
   ISSUE: College-level statistics
   ACTION: Simplify to "explore relationships"
   
3. T35.G7.01 - Systemic Impacts
   ISSUE: Systems thinking too advanced
   ACTION: Simplify to "list pros and cons"

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
================================================================================

Week 1: Data model updates (database schema)
Week 2: HIGH priority skill revisions (3 critical skills)
Week 3: MEDIUM priority terminology fixes (5 skills)
Week 4-5: UI/UX implementation (track badges, filtering)
Week 5-6: Content updates (activities, scaffolding)
Week 6-7: Documentation and communication
Week 7-8: Testing and validation
Week 8+: Launch and monitoring

TOTAL TIME: 8 weeks
TOTAL EFFORT: 370 hours (9-10 person-weeks)

================================================================================
RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Engineering: 160 hours (4 weeks for 1 engineer)
Content: 136 hours (3-4 weeks for 1 content creator)
Design: 40 hours (1 week for 1 designer)
PM: 32 hours (2 hours/week for 8 weeks)

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

TECHNICAL:
- All 31 flagged skills categorized
- Zero dependency violations
- UI clearly displays three tracks
- Performance impact <100ms

CONTENT:
- All HIGH priority revisions complete
- All MEDIUM priority revisions complete
- Scaffolding materials created
- Teacher guides updated

ADOPTION:
- 80%+ teachers understand track system
- 30%+ advanced students try enrichment
- 5%+ students explore competition
- 90%+ teacher satisfaction

OUTCOMES:
- Standard skill mastery remains 85%+
- No increase in student frustration
- Positive parent feedback >80%
- 3+ competition prep programs started

================================================================================
COMPETITION MAPPINGS
================================================================================

ACSL Junior (Grades 6-8):
- Algorithm complexity and optimization
- Boolean logic, number systems
- Data structures
- Relevant skills: T10.G8.02, T02.G7.03, T01.G8.02

Scratch Olympiad:
- Advanced game mechanics
- Creative storytelling
- Visual algorithms

Chinese Competitions (NOC, Lanqiao):
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Timed challenges
- Creative applications

Congressional App Challenge:

================================================================================
DEPENDENCY RULES
================================================================================

Standard skills can ONLY depend on other Standard skills
Enrichment can depend on Standard or Enrichment
Competition can depend on any track

This ensures Standard track is universally accessible.

================================================================================
QUALITY PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

1. Concrete before Abstract
2. Accessible Terminology
3. Discussion not Formal Analysis
4. Visual and Interactive
5. Age-Appropriate Cognitive Expectations

"IXL for coding" quality maintained throughout.

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
1. Review and approve deliverables
2. Assign implementation team
3. Set project kickoff meeting

WEEK 1:
1. Begin database schema updates
2. Create project tracking
3. Recruit pilot teachers

WEEK 2:
1. Revise 3 HIGH priority skills
2. Begin UI design
