ISSUE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (584 issues) - Dependencies on G3 or lower
---------------------------------------------------------

What: G6 skills that depend on Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, or Grade 3 skills
Why it's a problem: By Grade 6, these should be implicit knowledge
Impact: Creates clutter, makes skill map harder to maintain

Most frequent problematic dependencies:

From KINDERGARTEN (GK):
  - T01.GK.07: Find the pattern that repeats (referenced ~30 times)
  - T01.GK.08: Count how many times (referenced ~30 times)
  - T02.GK.03: Match a flowchart symbol to what it means (referenced ~15 times)
  - T02.GK.04: Put flowchart shapes in order (referenced ~15 times)
  - T03.GK.03: Pick which part of a recipe to do first (referenced ~15 times)
  - T07.GK.03: Match "repeat" to a picture (referenced ~10 times)
  - T09.GK.01: Recognize that something can change (referenced ~10 times)
  - T14.GK.01: Make a sprite jump with one block (referenced ~8 times)

From GRADE 1 (G1):
  - T01.G1.01: Put pictures in order to plant a seed (referenced ~10 times)
  - T03.G1.01: Break a class activity into numbered steps (referenced ~10 times)
  - T04.G1.01: Spot when two pictures show the same pattern (referenced ~5 times)

From GRADE 2 (G2):
  - T04.G2.01: Identify the repeating unit in a longer pattern (referenced ~15 times)
  - T09.G2.01: Create a variable that counts or tracks something (referenced ~5 times)

From GRADE 3 (G3):
  - T01.G3.01: Complete a simple script with missing blocks (referenced ~20 times)
  - T01.G3.02: Match a story description to a code sequence (referenced ~15 times)
  - T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence (referenced ~40 times)
  - T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop (referenced ~35 times)
  - T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script (referenced ~30 times)
  - T09.G3.01: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count (referenced ~45 times)
  - T09.G3.02: Use +, −, × in a simple calculation (referenced ~10 times)

PATTERN: The most problematic dependencies are foundational programming skills
from G3 (loops, conditionals, variables, basic scripts) that should absolutely
be assumed knowledge by Grade 6.

MEDIUM PRIORITY (299 issues)
-----------------------------

Type 1: Transitive Dependencies (~150 issues)
  What: Skill A depends on both B and C, but B already depends on C
  Why it's a problem: Redundant, makes dependency graph unnecessarily complex
  Example: If learning nested loops requires loops, and loops require sequences,
           don't list both "loops" AND "sequences" as dependencies

Type 2: Same-Topic Earlier-Grade Dependencies (~149 issues)
  What: G6 skill in topic T01 depends on G4 or G5 skill also in topic T01
  Why it's sometimes a problem: May be implicit progression within the topic
  Example: T01.G6.01 depending on T01.G5.01 might be obvious progression
  Note: Requires case-by-case review - some are legitimate, some aren't

LOW PRIORITY (6 issues)
-----------------------

What: Skills with potentially broad/vague names containing words like:
  - "multiple", "various", "several", "many", "comprehensive", "complete"

Why it's low priority: Only 6 out of 166 skills flagged, and upon review
  most are actually appropriately scoped for their context

Skills flagged:
  (These are acceptable and don't need changes - the analysis is conservative)

================================================================================
DETAILED FINDINGS BY TOPIC
================================================================================

TOPIC T01 – EVERYDAY ALGORITHMS (8 G6 skills)
----------------------------------------------
Issues: ~60 dependency problems

Common pattern:
- Heavy reliance on Kindergarten pattern recognition (GK.07, GK.08)
- Multiple dependencies on G3 scripting basics (G3.01, G3.02)
- Dependencies on G3 variables (T09.G3.01)

Example: T01.G6.01 "Count comparisons in linear and binary search"
  Current deps: T01.G1.01, T01.GK.07, T01.GK.08, T04.G2.01
  Should be: G4/G5 algorithm analysis skills only

TOPIC T02 – ALGORITHM DIAGRAMS (5 G6 skills)
---------------------------------------------
Issues: ~40 dependency problems

Common pattern:
- Dependencies on Kindergarten flowchart symbols (T02.GK.03, T02.GK.04)
- By Grade 6, flowchart notation should be well-established

Example: T02.G6.01 "Design a flowchart for a simple guessing game"
  Current deps: T02.GK.03, T02.GK.04, T07.G3.01, T08.G3.01
  Should be: T02.G5.03 (flowchart design) and similar G5 skills

TOPIC T07 – LOOPS (6 G6 skills)
--------------------------------
Issues: ~45 dependency problems

Common pattern:
- Every G6 loop skill depends on T07.G3.01 "Use a counted repeat loop"
- Every skill depends on Kindergarten counting (T07.GK.03, T07.GK.04)
- Basic loops are G3 - by G6 this should be foundational knowledge

Example: T07.G6.01 "Trace nested loops with variables"
  Current deps: T07.G3.01, T07.GK.03, T07.GK.04, T09.G3.01
  Should be: T07.G5.02 (nested loops) and T09.G5.02 (variables in loops)

TOPIC T09 – VARIABLES & EXPRESSIONS (5 G6 skills)
--------------------------------------------------
Issues: ~35 dependency problems

Common pattern:
- Every skill depends on T09.G3.01 "Create and use a numeric variable"
- Many depend on Kindergarten change recognition (T09.GK.01, T09.GK.02)
- Variables are introduced in G3 - by G6 this is basic knowledge

Example: T09.G6.01 "Use variables to represent real-world quantities"
  Current deps: T09.G3.01, T09.GK.01, T09.GK.02
  Should be: T09.G5.01, T09.G5.02 (advanced variable usage)

TOPIC T14 – 2D GAMES (6 G6 skills)
-----------------------------------
Issues: ~40 dependency problems

Common pattern:
- Dependencies on Kindergarten game mechanics (T14.GK.01, T14.GK.02)
- Dependencies on G3 basics (T08.G3.01, T09.G3.01, T06.G3.01)
- Game skills build on years of prior experience

Example: T14.G6.01 "Character state machine"
  Current deps: T08.G3.01, T09.G3.01, T14.GK.01, T14.GK.02
  Should be: T08.G5.02, T14.G5.01, T14.G5.03 (advanced game mechanics)

[Similar patterns exist across ALL 36 topics]

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
================================================================================

ACTION 1: Remove G3-and-lower dependencies (HIGH PRIORITY)
-----------------------------------------------------------

What to do:
1. For each G6 skill, review all dependencies
2. Remove any dependency on a skill from GK, G1, G2, or G3
3. If needed, add appropriate G4 or G5 dependencies in their place

Rationale:
- By Grade 6, students have 6-7 years of curriculum experience
- Kindergarten through Grade 3 skills are foundational and assumed
- Listing them creates unnecessary noise in the skill map

Expected impact:
- Eliminates 584 HIGH priority issues
- Makes skill map cleaner and more readable
- Better reflects the progressive nature of the curriculum
- Reduces maintenance burden

Automation:
- Can be largely automated with a Python script
- Script should parse allskills.md, identify G6 skills, filter dependencies
- Manual review needed for suggested G4/G5 replacements

ACTION 2: Review and remove transitive dependencies (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What to do:
1. Build the complete dependency graph
2. For each skill, identify which dependencies are already transitive
3. Remove redundant dependencies that are covered transitively

Example:
  If T01.G6.01 depends on T01.G5.01
  And T01.G5.01 depends on T01.G4.01
  Then T01.G6.01 should NOT also list T01.G4.01

Rationale:
- Simplifies the dependency graph
- Makes it easier to understand direct prerequisites
- Reduces maintenance when dependencies change

Expected impact:
- Eliminates ~150 MEDIUM priority issues
- Makes dependency chains clearer
- Reduces redundancy

Automation:
- Requires graph traversal algorithm
- Can be automated but needs careful validation
- Should preserve intentional "shortcut" dependencies if any exist

ACTION 3: Review same-topic dependencies (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
-----------------------------------------------------------

What to do:
- For each G6 skill depending on a G4/G5 skill in the SAME topic:
  - Ask: Is this a clear prerequisite or just background knowledge?
  - If it's obvious progression (basic → advanced), consider removing
  - If it's a distinct prerequisite, keep it

Examples to remove:
  T01.G6.01 → T01.G5.01 (if G6.01 is just "more advanced G5.01")

Examples to keep:
  T14.G6.01 → T14.G5.03 (if G6.01 truly requires specific G5.03 knowledge)

Rationale:
- Some same-topic dependencies are implicit progression
- Others are legitimate prerequisites
- Needs case-by-case judgment

Expected impact:
- Eliminates ~149 MEDIUM priority issues (selectively)
- Makes topic progressions clearer
- Reduces some redundancy

Automation:
- Cannot be fully automated (requires semantic understanding)
- Can flag for manual review
- Requires domain knowledge to decide

ACTION 4: No action on broad skills (LOW PRIORITY)
---------------------------------------------------

What to do:
- Review the 6 flagged skills
- Confirm they are appropriately scoped
- No changes needed unless review reveals actual issues

Rationale:
- Only 6 skills flagged out of 166
- Conservative flagging means likely false positives
- Skills appear appropriately scoped in context

Expected impact:
- None (no changes needed)

================================================================================
VALIDATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

After applying fixes, verify these conditions:

DEPENDENCY RULES:
□ No G6 skill depends on GK, G1, G2, or G3 skills
□ All dependencies are on G4, G5, or G6 skills only
□ Cross-topic dependencies are still appropriate
□ No transitive dependencies are listed as direct dependencies

CURRICULUM INTEGRITY:
□ All skills still have a clear learning progression
□ No skill becomes "orphaned" (unreachable from earlier grades)
□ Dependency chains are logically sound
□ Prerequisites still make sense for each skill

GRAPH PROPERTIES:
□ Dependency graph remains acyclic (no circular dependencies)
□ All paths from GK to G8 are still valid
□ No disconnected subgraphs (all skills reachable)

DOCUMENTATION:
□ Changes are documented
□ Rationale for major changes is recorded
□ Edge cases and exceptions are noted

================================================================================

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

STRENGTHS OF CURRENT G6 SKILLS:
✓ Well-defined and specific (only 6 out of 166 flagged as potentially broad)
✓ No circular dependencies (excellent graph structure)
✓ Comprehensive coverage across 36 diverse topics
✓ Clear progression from earlier grades

PRIMARY ISSUE:
✗ Over-specification of dependencies on G3 and lower grades
✗ 584 dependencies that should be implicit knowledge

ROOT CAUSE:
- Likely overly cautious when initially specifying dependencies
- Better to be explicit than miss a prerequisite
- But by G6, GK-G3 skills should be assumed foundational

SOLUTION:
Apply the simple rule: "G6 skills depend only on G4, G5, or G6 skills"
- Everything from G3 and below is assumed implicit knowledge
- This is not removing prerequisites - it's acknowledging assumed knowledge
- Students reaching G6 have mastered GK-G5 content

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Cleaner, more maintainable skill map
- Easier to understand and navigate
- Better reflects progressive curriculum design
- Preserves all learning pathways and prerequisites
- Reduces noise and clutter in documentation

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- LOW RISK: No learning pathways are broken
- LOW RISK: No prerequisites are actually removed (just implicit vs explicit)
- MEDIUM RISK: Some edge cases may need manual review
- MITIGATION: Thorough validation phase before final implementation

RECOMMENDATION:
Proceed with implementation as outlined in the Implementation Plan.
The benefits far outweigh the minimal risks.
