================================================================================
CRITICAL PATHWAYS IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

1. RESPONSIBLE COMPUTING PATHWAY (PRIMARY)
   T32 (Security) → T35 (Impacts) → T36 (Responsibility)
   - Grade 7-8 synthesis = professional ethics
   - Strong pedagogical progression

2. TECHNICAL SYSTEMS PATHWAY
   T30 (Hardware) → T31 (Internet) → T33 (Platforms)
   - Understanding computing ecosystem
   - Each layer builds understanding

3. AI ETHICS PATHWAY
   T21-T24 (AI Applications) → T35 (Impacts) → T36 (Ethics)
   - Critical bridge: T28.G8.03 → T35.G7.01 → T36
   - Bias understanding essential

4. APPLICATIONS INFORM IMPACTS
   T14-T24 (All Applications) → T35 (Impacts) → T36 (Responsibility)
   - Concrete examples for ethical thinking
   - Real-world contexts

5. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
   T34 (History) connects to T35 (Impacts) and T36 (Responsibility)
   - Not memorization, but context
   - Informs future decisions

================================================================================
NOTABLE SYNTHESIS SKILLS (Technical + Ethical Integration)
================================================================================

Grade 7-8 Integration Points:

T32.G7-G8: Advanced Security + Ethical Practices
- Security is both technical AND responsibility
- Prerequisite for T36 responsibility

T35.G7-G8: Impact Synthesis
- T35.G7.01: Recognizing bias (connects to T28.G8.03)
- T35.G8.01: Systemic impacts (foundation for T36)
- Understanding consequences across domains

T36.G8.01: RESPONSIBLE COMPUTING CAPSTONE
- Integration of ALL K-8 learning
- Technical understanding + ethical responsibility
- Professional citizenship preparation
