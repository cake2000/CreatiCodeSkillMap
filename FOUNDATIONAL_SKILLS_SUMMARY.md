## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: 41 Skills (Not More, Not Less)

**Rationale:**
- Covers all foundational blocks
- Manageable in 3-week timeline
- Proven granularity (IXL model)
- Balance depth vs. breadth

**Alternative Considered:** 60-80 skills (too many, overwhelming)

### Decision 2: Grade 3 Only (Not K-3)

**Rationale:**
- K-2 uses picture-based skills (different format)
- Grade 3 is cognitive threshold for coding
- Empirical data shows 154% dependency jump
- Clear transition point

**Alternative Considered:** Gradual K-3 ramp (less clear, harder to track)

### Decision 3: Block Categories as Topics

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with Scratch block palette
- Familiar to teachers
- Natural grouping
- Easy to find blocks

**Alternative Considered:** Conceptual topics (harder to map to platform)

### Decision 4: 6 Gateway Skills (Not All Equal Priority)

**Rationale:**
- Empirical dependency data
- Focus instructional time
- Clear priorities for teachers
- Intervention targeting

**Alternative Considered:** All skills equal weight (misses leverage points)

### Decision 5: 3-Week Timeline (Not Semester-Long)

**Rationale:**
- Minimum Viable Curriculum
- Urgency and focus
- Get to projects faster
- Can extend if needed

**Alternative Considered:** Semester-long (too slow, students lose interest)

## Common Questions

### Q: Can students skip skills they "already know"?

**A:** No - mastery must be demonstrated. Students can test out by:
1. Completing the skill challenge
2. Passing auto-grading checks
3. Explaining the concept

Even if familiar, students should demonstrate mastery to ensure no gaps.

### Q: What if a student is stuck on a gateway skill?

**A:** Gateway skills require intervention:
1. Small group reteaching
2. One-on-one tutoring
3. Peer buddies
4. Extra practice activities
5. Parent involvement

Do NOT move forward until gateway is mastered - it unlocks too much.

### Q: Can we do this faster than 3 weeks?

**A:** Not recommended. Students need:
- Time to practice
- Time to internalize
- Time for creativity
- Time to debug

Rushing leads to surface learning, not deep understanding.

### Q: What about students who finish early?

**A:** Provide:
- Extension challenges (harder versions)
- Creative projects
- Peer tutoring opportunities
- Preview of Grade 4 content
- Competition prep

Early finishers should go deeper, not just wider.

### Q: How do we assess mastery?

**A:** Three-part assessment:
1. **Auto-grading:** Code works correctly
2. **Explanation:** Can explain what code does
3. **Application:** Can use skill in new context

All three = mastery.
