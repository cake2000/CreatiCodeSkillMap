# K-2 Picture-Based Skills: Quality Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive quality standards for creating developmentally appropriate, picture-based, auto-gradable skills for K-2 students (ages 5-8) in the CreatiCode Skill Map.

---

## 1. Reading Level & Text Requirements

### Text Minimization
- **Kindergarten**: Maximum 5-8 words per instruction
- **Grade 1**: Maximum 8-12 words per instruction
- **Grade 2**: Maximum 12-15 words per instruction

### Vocabulary Standards
- Use only high-frequency sight words appropriate for grade level
- Avoid multi-syllable words unless absolutely necessary
- Use concrete, familiar nouns (dog, cat, food) over abstract terms
- Avoid technical jargon; use simple computing terms (computer, not device; click, not select)

### Reading Support
✅ **REQUIRED:**
- Audio narration for ALL text instructions
- Large, clear fonts (minimum 18pt for K, 16pt for G1-2)
- Dyslexia-friendly fonts (e.g., OpenDyslexic, Arial, Comic Sans)
- High contrast text (black on white or dark blue on light yellow)
- Text-to-speech available with slow/normal/fast speeds

✅ **RECOMMENDED:**
- Picture icons next to key words
- Color-coded or highlighted key words
- Option to replay audio
- Visual instructions in addition to text where possible

❌ **AVOID:**
- Cursive or decorative fonts
- All caps text (hard to read)
- Light gray text on white backgrounds
- Text over busy background images
- Tiny labels or fine print

---

## 2. Visual Design Standards

### Image Clarity
- **Minimum size**: 120x120px for K, 100x100px for G1-2
- **Maximum items on screen**: 12 for K, 15 for G1-2, 20 for G2
- **Style**: Consistent, cartoon-friendly illustrations
- **Detail level**: Simple but recognizable; avoid excessive detail
- **Backgrounds**: Clean, uncluttered; white or subtle color

### Color & Contrast
- **Minimum contrast ratio**: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for graphics (WCAG AA)
- **Color usage**: Never use color as the ONLY differentiator
  - ✅ GOOD: Red circles AND blue squares (shape + color)
  - ❌ BAD: Red circles AND blue circles (color only)
- **Color-blind safe**: Test with grayscale and color-blind simulators
- **Palette**: Bright, cheerful colors; avoid muddy or dull tones

### Layout & Spacing
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 60px × 60px for K, 44px × 44px for G1-2
- **Spacing**: Minimum 20px between interactive elements
- **Alignment**: Clear, logical layout (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- **Visual hierarchy**: Important items larger/higher contrast
- **White space**: Generous use to prevent visual overwhelm

### Visual Feedback
✅ **REQUIRED:**
- Immediate visual response to all interactions (highlight, grow, glow)
- Clear indication of selected/active state
- Progress indicators (e.g., "3 of 6 completed")
- Distinct correct/incorrect feedback visuals

---

## 3. Interaction Complexity

### Interaction Steps
- **Kindergarten**: 1-2 interaction steps maximum
  - Example: "Drag item to slot" (one step)
- **Grade 1**: 2-3 interaction steps maximum
  - Example: "Select item, then drag to category" (two steps)
- **Grade 2**: 3-4 interaction steps maximum
  - Example: "Read question, compare options, click answer" (three steps)

### Gesture Complexity
✅ **APPROVED Gestures:**
- Single tap/click
- Drag and drop (with snap-to guidance)
- Draw connecting lines (with magnetic endpoints)
- Swipe (if very clearly indicated)

❌ **AVOID:**
- Multi-touch gestures (pinch, rotate)
- Double-tap
- Long press (unless clearly taught first)
- Complex drawing or tracing (fine motor challenge)
- Typing or text entry (K-G1)

### Cognitive Load
- **One concept at a time**: Don't mix multiple learning objectives
- **Clear success criteria**: Students should know what "correct" means
- **Predictable patterns**: Consistent UI across all activities
- **No memory requirements**: All needed information visible on screen
- **No time pressure**: Untimed activities (optional timer for data only)

---

## 4. Cultural Responsiveness

### Diversity & Representation
✅ **INCLUDE:**
- Diverse racial and ethnic representation in characters
- Various family structures (single parent, two parents, grandparents, etc.)
- People with disabilities in active, normalized roles
- Gender diversity in all roles (not stereotyped)
- Variety of cultural practices, foods, clothing, homes
- Urban, suburban, and rural settings

❌ **AVOID:**
- Stereotypical representations
- Token diversity (one representative per group)
- Assuming all students have the same experiences
- Religious-specific content in secular skills
- Implied "normal" or "default" family/culture

### Universal Contexts
- Use globally recognizable concepts when possible
- Avoid region-specific references (e.g., snow in winter for all)
- Be mindful of socioeconomic assumptions (not everyone has computers at home, takes vacations, etc.)
- Include multiple cultural perspectives on topics
- Use inclusive language (caregiver instead of mom/dad, celebration instead of holiday)

### Accessibility to All Learners
- Support English Language Learners (ELLs) with visual emphasis
- Provide multiple means of representation
- Offer choice in themes when possible
- Ensure content is trauma-informed (no scary imagery, no assumed safety)

---

## 8. Time Estimates by Grade

### Kindergarten
- **Target time**: 2-3 minutes per skill
- **Maximum time**: 5 minutes
- **Rationale**: Short attention span, developing stamina

### Grade 1
- **Target time**: 3-4 minutes per skill
- **Maximum time**: 7 minutes
- **Rationale**: Increasing stamina, still need brevity

### Grade 2
- **Target time**: 4-5 minutes per skill
- **Maximum time**: 10 minutes
- **Rationale**: Growing focus, can handle slightly longer activities

### Time Management Strategies
- Break longer skills into 2-3 shorter ones
- Provide save/pause functionality
- Don't penalize for time spent
- Track time for analytics, not for grading

---

## 9. Auto-Grading Quality

### Correctness Checking
✅ **ACCURATE:**
- Clear, unambiguous correct answers
- Tested with multiple student attempts
- Edge cases considered
- Generous tolerance for motor skill variance (clicking, dragging)

❌ **PROBLEMS TO AVOID:**
- Multiple "correct" interpretations
- Pixel-perfect precision requirements
- Timing dependencies
- Hidden tricks or gotchas

### Feedback Quality

#### Correct Answer Feedback
- ✅ Immediate and enthusiastic
- ✅ Variety of messages (randomized)
- ✅ Visual celebration (stars, confetti)
- ✅ Audio celebration (happy sound, voice)
- ✅ Specific praise when possible ("You put them all in the right order!")

#### Incorrect Answer Feedback
- ✅ Gentle and encouraging, never negative
- ✅ Informative hints (not just "wrong")
- ✅ Scaffolded help (more support with each attempt)
- ✅ Show correct answer after 3 attempts
- ✅ Opportunity to try again or move on

**TONE Examples:**
- ✅ GOOD: "Not quite! Let's try again. Think about what comes first."
- ❌ BAD: "Wrong! That's not right. Try harder."

### Partial Credit (Grade 2 Only)
- Can award partial credit for "mostly correct" answers
- Must be clear and consistent
- Must not confuse students
- K-G1: All-or-nothing grading is clearer and more appropriate
