## Grade K (PreK–K)

Data collection at Grade K focuses on concrete, observable data in daily life and the idea that collecting information helps us learn and make decisions.

### T26.GK.01 – Spot data all around

- **Short name:** Recognize data in everyday life
- **Description:** Students identify examples of data they encounter daily (e.g., colors of clothes, types of animals they see, temperatures, number of people) and recognize that information can be collected about these things. This builds awareness that data exists before any formal collection or analysis.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, picture matching. Show 6-8 everyday scenarios (a classroom, playground, kitchen, etc.) and ask students to point out or circle things that could be counted or measured (colors, sizes, quantities). Auto-grading checks selections.
- **CSTA:** EK‑DAA‑DF‑01 (Demonstrate how people create and collect various types of data to help answer questions).

### T26.GK.02 – Count and record simple observations

- **Short name:** Tally marks and simple counts
- **Description:** Students collect a very simple type of data by counting or tallying occurrences of something in their environment (e.g., how many red shirts, how many jumps the character takes, how many times a sound plays) and record the count using tallies, fingers, or simple marks. This introduces the mechanics of data collection in a concrete way.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + concept, interactive activity. A CreatiCode project shows repeated events (e.g., a character jumping 5 times, objects passing by). Students place blocks or click to tally each occurrence, then report the final count. Auto-grading checks the tally count against the simulated events.
- **CSTA:** EK‑DAA‑DF‑01.

### T26.GK.03 – Sort objects into groups

- **Short name:** Sort into categories
- **Description:** Students take a collection of items (pictures or blocks) with different attributes (colors, shapes, sizes) and physically sort them into groups by one attribute. This builds the foundational idea of organizing data by category.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, drag-and-drop or physical activity. Students are given 10-12 picture cards of items in different colors and shapes, with instructions to sort by color (or shape). They drag items into labeled bins. Auto-grading checks that items are in the correct categories.
- **CSTA:** EK‑DAA‑DF‑01 (foundational understanding of grouping and organizing).

## Grade 1

Grade 1 introduces more intentional data collection methods and very simple ways to represent collected data.

### T26.G1.01 – Collect data by asking a question

- **Short name:** Ask and collect responses
- **Description:** Students pose a simple yes/no or one-of-few-choices question (e.g., "Do you like apples or oranges?" "What is your favorite color: red, blue, or yellow?") to peers and collect their answers by marking or listing responses. This connects asking a question to gathering information.
- **Challenge format:** Concept + coding, guided project. A CreatiCode sprite asks a question using `ask and wait` blocks and students help it count responses. Starter script includes one `ask` block; students may add code to count or store each answer. Auto-grading checks that at least 5 responses are collected and stored.
- **CSTA:** E1‑DAA‑DF‑01 (Compare numeric and non-numeric data in terms of how they are collected and what they can tell us).

### T26.G1.02 – Compare two groups of data

- **Short name:** Which group has more?
- **Description:** Students collect two small datasets (e.g., favorite colors from boys and girls, or scores from two games) and compare them to answer simple questions (which has more, which is smaller, etc.). This introduces the idea that comparing data can reveal patterns.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, guided analysis. A CreatiCode project shows two lists or two simple data counts on screen. Students choose from options: "Red has more than Blue?" "Which score is higher?" Auto-grading compares selected answer to the displayed counts.
- **CSTA:** E1‑DAA‑DF‑01.

### T26.G1.03 – Make a simple list from collected data

- **Short name:** Keep a list of collected items
- **Description:** Students collect information about a small set of items (e.g., names of three favorite snacks, types of plants in the classroom) and create a simple list by writing or selecting items. This builds familiarity with lists as an organizing structure.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, starter project. A sprite asks "What is a snack you like?" Students add blocks to `add` responses to a CreatiCode list. They collect at least 3 responses. Auto-grading checks that the list contains the correct number of items and that the list `add` block is used.
- **CSTA:** E1‑DAA‑DF‑01, PRO‑DH (understanding data structures).

## Grade 2

Grade 2 students collect data using multiple methods (observation, measurement, simple surveys) and begin organizing it into more structured forms.

### T26.G2.01 – Collect data through observation and measurement

- **Short name:** Observe and measure
- **Description:** Students collect data by observing or measuring something (e.g., plant heights over time, number of steps to cross the room, sound volume in different parts of the classroom) using simple tools or counting. This introduces the idea that data can come from direct observation as well as surveys.
- **Challenge format:** Concept + coding, experiment. A CreatiCode project simulates repeated measurements (e.g., a sprite moves different distances, or a sensor reports varying values). Students record 4-6 measurements in a list or table by reading on-screen displays and entering or selecting values. Auto-grading checks that recorded values match the displayed measurements.
- **CSTA:** E2‑DAA‑DF‑01 (Collect numeric and non-numeric data, using multiple methods, including observation, measurement, and survey).

### T26.G2.02 – Organize data into a simple table

- **Short name:** Make a data table (rows and columns)
- **Description:** Students take collected data points and organize them into a table with rows and columns, where each row represents one record and each column represents an attribute (e.g., a table of "Student Name" and "Number of Books Read"). This is the first structured data organization beyond simple lists.
- **Challenge format:** Concept + coding, table construction. Students receive 8-10 data points (e.g., names and favorite colors of classmates) and must organize them into a two-column table in a CreatiCode project using table blocks or visual interface. Auto-grading checks row and column labels and that data entries are in correct cells.
- **CSTA:** E2‑DAA‑DF‑01, DAA‑DF (foundational table organization).

### T26.G2.03 – Use a survey to collect class data

- **Short name:** Run a simple survey
- **Description:** Students design and administer a very simple survey (one question with a few preset response options, e.g., "What is your favorite pet: dog, cat, fish, or bird?") to the class and record all responses. This introduces survey methodology in a hands-on way.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + design, guided project. A CreatiCode sprite presents a survey question and students add blocks to collect responses (using `ask and wait` or button clicks). They gather at least 10 responses and can view or list the results. Auto-grading checks that the survey is deployed (script runs and collects responses) and that results are recorded.
- **CSTA:** E2‑DAA‑DF‑01.

### T26.G2.04 – Recognize missing or incomplete data

- **Short name:** Find gaps in collected data
- **Description:** Students are shown a dataset with some missing values or incomplete entries and identify which pieces are missing (e.g., a table where some cells are blank, or a list where a response says "skip"). This builds awareness of data quality.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, inspection task. Show a table or list with 2-3 deliberately missing entries. Students select or circle the missing or incomplete cells and optionally state why the data is incomplete. Auto-grading checks selections.
- **CSTA:** DAA‑DF (foundational awareness of data completeness).

## Grade 3

Grade 3 students work with more complex data collection, organize data collaboratively, and introduce basic data verification and quality checks.

### T26.G3.01 – Collaborate to collect consistent data

- **Short name:** Collect data as a team with a procedure
- **Description:** Students work together to collect data following a clear procedure (e.g., all students measure height the same way, or all tally observations using the same categories). They understand that consistent methods help ensure reliable data.
- **Challenge format:** Concept + design, collaborative project. Students are given a data collection task with a written procedure (e.g., "Measure your desk length using a ruler in centimeters, round to nearest cm, write your result"). They collect 8-10 data points following the procedure and then verify that entries match the procedure (e.g., all are in centimeters, all are reasonable). Auto-grading checks that data entries follow the format and reasonable value ranges.
- **CSTA:** E3‑DAA‑DF‑01 (Collaborate with peers to collect numeric and non-numeric data, following consistent procedures).

### T26.G3.02 – Evaluate data for accuracy and completeness

- **Short name:** Check data quality
- **Description:** Students examine a dataset and identify problems such as duplicates, out-of-range values, missing entries, or inconsistent units (e.g., some temperatures in Celsius and some in Fahrenheit). They evaluate whether the data is trustworthy.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, inspection and debugging. A CreatiCode project or spreadsheet shows a dataset with 3-5 deliberate quality issues (missing value, duplicate row, a clearly wrong entry like age = 250). Students identify and list each issue and optionally suggest corrections. Auto-grading checks that issues are identified correctly.
- **CSTA:** E3‑DAA‑DF‑02 (Evaluate collected data for accuracy and completeness).

### T26.G3.03 – Organize data in a labeled table with multiple columns

- **Short name:** Build a multi-attribute table
- **Description:** Students take collected data and organize it into a table with multiple columns representing different attributes (e.g., a table with columns for "Plant Name", "Height in cm", "Days to Sprout", "Color"). Each row is one record. This extends the Grade 2 skill to handle richer, more realistic data.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + design, table building. Students receive a dataset of 10-15 records with 3-4 attributes each (e.g., student names with age, grade, and favorite sport). They organize it into a CreatiCode table or visual table interface with correct column headers and all entries. Auto-grading checks column labels and that all entries are correctly placed in rows and columns.
- **CSTA:** E4‑DAA‑DF‑01 (adapted for Grade 3: Organize data into tables where rows represent a "record" and columns represent attributes).

### T26.G3.04 – Retrieve and use data from a created list or table

- **Short name:** Read data from a list or table
- **Description:** Students write code to access specific pieces of data from a list (e.g., the name of a student at position 3) or table (e.g., the height of the plant in row 2) using index or item-access blocks. This introduces programming with structured data.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, block-filling. A starter project has a list or table already created (e.g., a list of animal names or a table of temperatures). Students use blocks like `item ( ) of [list]` or table lookup blocks to retrieve specific values and make a sprite display or use them in a script. Auto-grading checks that the correct data item is retrieved and used.
- **CSTA:** E3‑DAA‑DF‑01, PRO‑DH (Data Handling).

## Grade 4

Grade 4 students conduct more independent data collection (including logging game events), refine data organization, and introduce very basic data interpretation.

### T26.G4.01 – Design and conduct a survey with a clear question

- **Short name:** Design a survey
- **Description:** Students formulate a data question they want to answer (e.g., "What is the most popular sport?") and design a survey with multiple-choice response options. They administer it and record all responses. This introduces intentional survey design.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + design, guided project. Students sketch or describe their data question and response options, then create a CreatiCode survey using `ask` or button widgets and collect responses from the class (at least 15). The project records and displays results. Auto-grading checks that the survey was run, at least 15 responses were collected, and results are stored.
- **CSTA:** DAA‑DF (adapted for Grade 4: Data collection methods).

### T26.G4.02 – Log events in a game using a counter or list

- **Short name:** Track game events with variables or lists
- **Description:** Students build a simple game or interactive project where a variable or list is used to record events that happen (e.g., every time a coin is collected, the count increases; every time a button is pressed, a record is added to a list). The log grows as the game runs.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, starter game project. A provided game has incomplete logging code. Students add blocks to track events: e.g., when a sprite touches a coin, increase a `coins_collected` variable, or add an entry to a `events` list recording the time. The game runs for 5-10 seconds; auto-grading checks that the log correctly records all event occurrences during the run.
- **CSTA:** E4‑DAA‑DF‑01, PRO‑DH.

### T26.G4.03 – Create metadata for a dataset

- **Short name:** Document what your data is
- **Description:** Students create a brief written description of a dataset they collected: what was measured, how it was measured, when, and by whom. This is the beginning of understanding metadata.
- **Challenge format:** Concept + design, documentation. Students provide a dataset (real or simulated) and write or fill in a metadata template: "What is this data about?", "What were you measuring?", "Who collected it and when?", "What units?" Auto-grading checks that a meaningful description is provided for each section.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DF‑04 (adapted for Grade 4: Create metadata that generally describes the purpose and contents of datasets, who collected the data, and how the data were collected).

### T26.G4.04 – Spot patterns in organized data

- **Short name:** Find patterns in tables or lists
- **Description:** Students examine an organized dataset (table or list) and identify simple patterns or trends (e.g., "More students chose red than blue", "Plant A grew taller than Plant B", "Scores increased each round"). This is early data interpretation.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, data reading. A CreatiCode project displays a table or list of 15-20 data points (e.g., daily temperatures, survey response counts, or game scores). Students answer 2-3 questions: "Which is most common?", "Did values increase or decrease?", "Are any two values the same?" Auto-grading checks answers against the data.
- **CSTA:** DAA‑DI (foundational pattern recognition).

## Grade 5

Grade 5 students expand data collection using computational tools, organize multi-column data, and begin to analyze data to answer their questions.

### T26.G5.01 – Collect data using sensors or automated methods

- **Short name:** Use sensors or timers to collect data
- **Description:** Students create a program that uses CreatiCode's built-in reporters (like timer, loudness, mouse position, or simulated sensors) to automatically collect numeric data over time, storing results in a list or table. This introduces automated data logging.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, data-logging project. Starter project includes a sensor reporter (e.g., `timer` or a simulated temperature sensor that outputs random values). Students build code to repeatedly collect readings (using a loop) and add each to a list or table for 30-60 seconds or 10-20 iterations. Auto-grading checks that the list/table contains multiple entries from the sensor and that readings are stored correctly.
- **CSTA:** E5‑DAA‑DF‑01 (Collect different types of data, using computational tools (e.g., sensors, cameras, online surveys)).

### T26.G5.02 – Organize complex data into a table structure

- **Description:** Students organize a more complex, real-world dataset (20+ records with 4+ columns) into a properly structured table, with clear headers and consistent data types in each column (e.g., all numeric, all text, etc.). This reinforces table structure and data consistency.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + design, table-building. Students receive a raw dataset (e.g., a list of sports team records with columns for team name, wins, losses, points, and city) and import or manually build it into a CreatiCode table. They must set column names and ensure each row follows the structure. Auto-grading checks column count, headers, row count, and data type consistency.
- **CSTA:** DAA‑DF (Data Fundamentals, advanced).

### T26.G5.03 – Filter or sort data by a rule

- **Short name:** Sort or filter data in a table
- **Description:** Students use code blocks or table operations to sort data (e.g., scores from highest to lowest) or filter it (e.g., show only students with scores above 80) to help answer a data question. This introduces basic data processing.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, data manipulation. A starter project has a CreatiCode table with student names and test scores (15-20 rows). Students write code to filter (e.g., create a new list of only scores >= 80) or sort (e.g., arrange rows by score, descending). The filtered/sorted result is displayed on screen. Auto-grading checks that the filtered or sorted output is correct.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DP‑05 (adapted for Grade 5: Use computational tools to organize, filter, group, and aggregate data).

### T26.G5.04 – Compare collected data sets to find differences

- **Short name:** Compare two datasets
- **Description:** Students collect (or are given) two similar datasets (e.g., favorite foods from boys vs. girls, temperature readings from morning vs. afternoon) and compare them to draw simple conclusions (e.g., which group preferred pizza more, when was it warmer).
- **Challenge format:** Concept + coding, comparative analysis. A project displays two tables or lists side-by-side (e.g., scores from two games, or response counts from two survey groups). Students answer questions: "Which group's total is larger?", "Which response is most popular in each group?", "Did patterns change between groups?" Auto-grading checks answers against the data.
- **CSTA:** DAA‑DI (Data Investigation).

### T26.G5.05 – Save or export collected data

- **Short name:** Store data for later use
- **Description:** Students create a simple mechanism to save their collected data so it persists (using a variable, a list in the project, or a simple cloud block if available) rather than losing it when the program stops. This introduces the idea of data persistence.
- **Challenge format:** Coding, project extension. A starter project collects data during a game or activity. Students add blocks to store the final data (e.g., list of scores) into a named variable or use a CreatiCode `save` or cloud-storage block (if available). They then create a second script that loads and displays the saved data when the program starts again. Auto-grading checks that data is stored and retrievable across program restarts (or session simulations).
- **CSTA:** DAA‑DF (foundational data persistence).

### T26.G6.01 – Design a data collection plan for a research question

- **Short name:** Plan a data investigation
- **Description:** Students articulate a research question (e.g., "Do students exercise more on weekdays or weekends?" or "Which school lunch option is most popular?"), decide what data to collect, how to collect it, from whom, and how many samples to gather. They write or present a simple data collection plan.
- **Challenge format:** Concept + design, planning document. Students write a 3-5 sentence plan addressing: the research question, what will be measured, who will participate, and how data will be collected. They may also sketch or outline the data table structure they'll use. Auto-grading checks for clarity and feasibility (e.g., question is answerable with data, sample size is reasonable for the context).
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DI‑08 (Pose data questions that anticipate variability in the data).

### T26.G6.02 – Execute a multi-method data collection using surveys and observations

- **Challenge format:** Coding + activity, mixed-method collection. A CreatiCode project guides students to (1) ask survey questions and record responses, and (2) measure or count something observational (e.g., using a timer or counter). Data from both methods is stored in a single list or table. Students collect at least 10 survey responses and 5 observational data points. Auto-grading checks that both types of data are present and recorded.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DF‑03 (Use computational tools such as spreadsheets to collect and organize quantitative and qualitative data).

### T26.G6.03 – Share data across users using multiplayer or cloud blocks

- **Short name:** Share data with classmates

- **Challenge format:** Coding, multiplayer or cloud project. A CreatiCode project uses multiplayer or cloud blocks to maintain a shared list or counter. Students join a game session or shared project and contribute data (e.g., enter a score, add a response to a shared survey). All participants can see the growing shared dataset. Auto-grading checks that data from multiple users is combined and visible to all.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DF‑03, SAS‑NW (networks and shared resources).

### T26.G6.04 – Organize and document a dataset with metadata

- **Short name:** Create a complete dataset with documentation
- **Description:** Students take collected data and organize it into a CreatiCode table with clear column headers, consistent formatting, and write a brief metadata document describing the data (what was measured, by whom, when, units, any known limitations).
- **Challenge format:** Coding + documentation, project build. Students receive or have collected 20-30 data points with 3-4 attributes. They organize into a CreatiCode table and write a text description covering: purpose (what question are you answering), data collection method, date range, sample size, units, and any notes about quality or limitations. Auto-grading checks table organization and that metadata document is complete and accurate.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DF‑04 (Create metadata that generally describes the purpose and contents of datasets, who collected the data, and how the data were collected).

### T26.G6.05 – Clean and prepare data for analysis

- **Short name:** Fix data problems before analyzing
- **Description:** Students identify issues in a collected dataset (missing values, inconsistent units, typos, duplicates) and apply simple fixes: filling in missing entries, standardizing units, removing duplicates, or noting problematic rows. They create a "cleaned" version.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + debugging, data-cleaning project. A CreatiCode project or spreadsheet shows raw data with 3-5 deliberate quality issues (e.g., one row with missing age, one entry with temperature in Fahrenheit while others are Celsius, one duplicate row). Students either manually fix issues or write code to identify and flag them. The cleaned dataset is displayed. Auto-grading checks that issues are fixed and the cleaned dataset is valid.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DP‑07 (Identify errors in data (e.g., missing values, incorrectly formatted dates) and ways to fix them).

### T26.G7.01 – Formulate a clear, testable data question

- **Short name:** Ask a data-driven question
- **Description:** Students formulate a specific data question that can be answered by collecting and analyzing data, distinguishing it from questions answered by opinion or general knowledge. Examples: "Do taller students jump higher?" "Which type of music gets the most plays in our class?"
- **Challenge format:** Concept, question design. Students are given 5-6 potential research questions (mix of good data questions and non-data questions). They identify which are answerable with data and explain why. They may also write their own question. Auto-grading checks that identified questions are testable with data and explanations are sound.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DI‑08 (Pose data questions that anticipate variability in the data).

### T26.G7.02 – Collect data systematically using lists and tables

- **Challenge format:** Coding + activity, data-collection project. A starter CreatiCode project includes a table structure for students to fill, with clear column headers and instructions. Students conduct a brief survey or measurement campaign in class (e.g., measure shadow length at different times, or ask 30 people about preferred snacks). They input or add data to the table. Auto-grading checks that at least 20 entries are recorded with the correct structure and data types.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DF‑03 (Use computational tools such as spreadsheets to collect and organize quantitative and qualitative data).

### T26.G7.03 – Manipulate data with code (filter, sort, aggregate)

- **Short name:** Process data using loops and conditions

- **Challenge format:** Coding, data-manipulation challenge. A starter project has a CreatiCode table with 30-40 rows of student data (names, grades in multiple subjects). Students write code to (1) filter for students with average grade >= 80, or (2) sort by a specific subject grade, or (3) calculate average grade across all students. The filtered/sorted/aggregated result is displayed or stored. Auto-grading checks the correctness of the output.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DP‑05 (Use computational tools to organize, filter, group, and aggregate data).

### T26.G7.04 – Identify and correct data quality issues

- **Short name:** Debug and repair data
- **Description:** Students systematically review collected data, identify specific quality issues (duplicates, out-of-range values, inconsistent units, missing entries), and apply appropriate fixes. They document what was wrong and how they fixed it.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + documentation, data-debugging project. A CreatiCode project or provided dataset contains 5-10 deliberate errors (missing values, a clearly wrong entry like age = 500, unit inconsistencies, duplicate rows). Students identify each error, note its type, and fix it (or write code to flag it). They document the fixes. Auto-grading checks that errors are identified and corrected or documented.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DP‑07 (Identify errors in data (e.g., missing values, incorrectly formatted dates) and ways to fix them).

### T26.G7.05 – Draw simple conclusions from organized data

- **Short name:** Interpret data to answer questions
- **Description:** Students examine their collected and cleaned dataset and use it to answer the original data question. They identify the most common value, the largest/smallest, trends, or comparisons between groups, and state a simple conclusion.
- **Challenge format:** Concept + coding, data-analysis. Students have collected data and organized it (from a previous challenge or provided). They read the data from the table, make observations, and write 1-2 sentences explaining what the data tells them about their original question (e.g., "Most students prefer pizza over salad" or "Temperatures were higher in the afternoon"). Auto-grading checks that the conclusion is supported by the data shown.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DI‑08, MS‑DAA‑DI‑09 (Use computational tools to identify relationships among variables in a dataset and make classifications or predictions).

## Grade 8

Grade 8 students conduct comprehensive data investigations from question through analysis, work with more complex datasets, and consider ethical and social implications of data collection.

### T26.G8.01 – Design an ethical data collection process

- **Short name:** Plan ethical data practices
- **Description:** Students design a data collection for a research question while considering ethical issues: privacy (what personal data is necessary), consent (asking permission to collect data), fairness (including diverse participants, avoiding bias), and transparency (telling people what their data will be used for).
- **Challenge format:** Concept + design, ethics planning. Students outline a data collection plan for a given research question (e.g., "Do students in grades 6-8 exercise regularly?"). Their plan must address: What data will you collect? Will you ask permission? How will you protect privacy (e.g., not storing names with health data)? How will you ensure your sample is representative? Auto-grading checks for thoughtfulness and completeness in addressing ethical considerations.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑IM‑13 (Explain the benefits and risks of allowing personal data to be collected and incorporated into datasets).

### T26.G8.02 – Execute a complete data investigation (question to analysis)

- **Short name:** Conduct a full data investigation
- **Description:** Students execute an end-to-end data investigation: ask a testable question, collect 30-100 data points across multiple attributes, organize into a table, clean the data, filter/aggregate as needed, analyze to answer the question, and write a brief summary of findings and any limitations.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + research, major project. Students propose a research question, design a data collection plan (approved by teacher), conduct the collection using CreatiCode tools (surveys, sensors, or manual input), organize data in a table, clean any issues, and write a report with findings. Example: "Is there a relationship between minutes of study time and test scores?" Students would collect study time and test scores for 20+ students, create a table, analyze for correlation, and report findings. Auto-grading checks that data is organized, clean, and that analysis is appropriate for the question.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DI‑08, MS‑DAA‑DI‑09, MS‑DAA‑DI‑12 (Share the story of a data investigation with peers, including what data question was asked, how the data was collected and analyzed, and what evidence supports the conclusion).

### T26.G8.03 – Analyze relationships between variables in data

- **Short name:** Find connections between data columns
- **Description:** Students work with a multi-column dataset and analyze relationships between variables (e.g., "Do students who read more books also have higher vocabulary scores?" or "Is there a pattern between hours of screen time and sleep quality?"). They use filtering, sorting, or visual inspection to identify patterns.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + analysis, multi-variable investigation. A CreatiCode project provides a dataset with 3-4 attributes and 40+ rows (e.g., student name, books read, vocabulary score, comprehension score). Students use code or analysis to explore relationships: they might filter students by books read and compare average vocabulary scores, or sort by one column and observe changes in another. They identify and document one clear relationship (or note if no clear pattern exists). Auto-grading checks the correctness of the identified relationship against the data.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DI‑09 (Use computational tools to identify relationships among variables in a dataset and make classifications or predictions).

### T26.G8.04 – Recognize bias and limitations in data collection

- **Short name:** Spot bias and limitations
- **Description:** Students examine a dataset or a data collection process and identify potential biases (e.g., sampling only from one school excludes other communities, asking questions on an app excludes people without internet) and limitations (e.g., small sample size, measurements taken at only one time). They reflect on how these affect conclusions.
- **Challenge format:** Concept + analysis, critical evaluation. Students are given a dataset and a conclusion drawn from it (e.g., "Our survey of 20 students shows that most students prefer recess to homework" or "Measurements of plant growth show that Plant A grew faster"). They identify potential biases in how data was collected (sample size, participant selection, measurement timing) and consider how these limitations might affect the conclusion. They write 2-3 sentences explaining limitations. Auto-grading checks for reasonable identification of at least one bias or limitation and thoughtful reflection.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑IM‑14 (Analyze how decisions made during data collection, data processing, data analysis, and data presentation can lead to biased data, misleading conclusions, and compromised AI models).

### T26.G8.05 – Use cloud storage or multiplayer data to conduct group research

- **Short name:** Collaborate on shared data
- **Description:** Students work in a group to collect data where each member contributes to a shared table or list (using CreatiCode's cloud or multiplayer blocks), then collectively analyze the combined dataset. This introduces collaborative data science and networked data collection.
- **Challenge format:** Coding + collaboration, group data project. A team of 3-4 students is given a research question (e.g., "What are the favorite games across all teams?"). Each student adds their own local collection to a shared CreatiCode table using multiplayer/cloud blocks. The team then analyzes the combined data from all contributors (50+ total entries) and writes findings. Auto-grading checks that multiple contributors' data is merged correctly, that the analysis is based on the full dataset, and that the summary is coherent.
- **CSTA:** MS‑DAA‑DI‑08, SAS‑NW (understanding shared/networked data).

## Summary by Grade Band

- **K-1:** Intuitive data collection (counting, sorting, asking simple questions), first exposure to lists and tallying.
- **2-3:** Structured data collection (surveys, observations, measurements), introduction to tables and data verification.
- **4-5:** Game event logging, basic data filtering and sorting, automated data collection via sensors.
- **6-7:** Planned data investigations, cloud/multiplayer data sharing, data cleaning, simple relationship analysis.
- **8:** Ethical data practices, end-to-end investigations, bias recognition, collaborative research with shared data.

Each progression respects CSTA's DAA‑DF and DAA‑DP standards while leveraging CreatiCode's table variables, multiplayer blocks, and sensor capabilities to make data collection engaging and concrete for K-8 learners.
