# T35 (Impacts & Ethics) - Comprehensive Analysis
**Date:** 2024-11-24
**Total Skills:** 49 skills across grades K-8

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

T35 (Impacts & Ethics) is the largest and most complex topic in the skill map with 49 skills spanning K-8. The topic covers digital citizenship, privacy, accessibility, AI ethics, data ethics, and responsible technology use.

**Key Findings:**
- Strong overall progression from K-2 (unplugged/picture-based) to 3-8 (block-based with increasing complexity)
- Significant issues with overly broad skills in grades 6-8, especially AI ethics skills
- Complex multi-part skills that should be split for clearer learning objectives
- Heavy integration with AI topics (T21-T24) in upper grades
- Good scaffolding in K-5, but G6-G8 need restructuring
- Cross-topic dependencies well-documented but some violate X-2 rule

- G6 skill depends on T22.G6.01 (ChatGPT for analysis)
- ChatGPT introduction is at G3 (T22.G3.01), so X-2 is satisfied
- ✓ No violation

#### **VIOLATION: T35.G3.03 → T22.G3.01**
- G3 skill depends on ChatGPT at same grade
- ✓ Acceptable (same grade)

#### **VIOLATION: T35.G4.03.02 → T22.G4.01**
- G4 accessibility skill depends on AI Speaker at G4
- ✓ Acceptable (same grade)

#### **POTENTIAL VIOLATION: T35.G5.04 → T19.G5.01**
- G5 skill depends on Google Sheets at G5
- Need to verify T19 progression allows this
- Check: Is T19.G5.01 the first cloud storage skill?
- ⚠️ Flag for review

#### **NO X-2 VIOLATIONS FOUND WITHIN T35**
All T35-to-T35 dependencies respect grade progression

### 6. UNCLEAR OR NON-ACTIONABLE DESCRIPTIONS

#### Grade 5
**T35.G5.02 - Debate digital well-being scenarios**
- Description: "Students debate policy scenarios (device-free times, notifications) referencing evidence on focus and health."
- Issue: Doesn't specify what evidence or how to obtain it
- **Fix:** Add: "Students research evidence on screen time effects (provided articles/studies) and use evidence to support positions in structured debate format."

#### Grade 6
**T35.G6.04 - Examine digital divide data**
- Description: "Learners interpret charts (broadband availability, device ownership) and propose community actions."
- Issue: Too vague, unclear what "propose community actions" means
- **Fix:** Add: "Students analyze 2-3 provided data visualizations about digital access disparities, identify the most underserved groups, and propose 2-3 specific, realistic community actions with justification (e.g., 'School library extended hours because 30% lack home internet')."

#### Grade 8
**T35.G8.01.01 - Analyze AI chatbots' impact on information literacy**
- Description: Current description is incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in file)
- **Fix:** Complete the description with specific analysis activities

### 7. GRADE APPROPRIATENESS ISSUES

#### **EXCELLENT K-2 DESIGN**
- All K-2 skills are unplugged/picture-based ✓
- Clear, concrete, age-appropriate activities ✓
- No block coding required ✓

#### **GOOD G3+ TRANSITION**
- G3.01 is appropriate first block-based ethics skill ✓
- Uses basic blocks (if, variables, widgets) ✓

#### **CONCERN: G6-G8 COMPLEXITY**
- Many G6-G8 skills are at near-adult complexity levels
- Multiple skills require sophisticated research, analysis, policy writing
- May be overwhelming without better scaffolding
- **Recommendation:** After splitting broad skills, assess if complexity is appropriate

## SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

1. **Split 13 overly broad skills** (see Section 1 for detailed breakdown)
   - Grade 6: 4 skills → 13 skills (T35.G6.01, G6.03.01, G6.03.03, G6.05.02)
   - Grade 7: 5 skills → 16 skills (T35.G7.01.01, G7.04.01, G7.04.02, G7.05.01, G7.05.02)
   - Grade 8: 2 skills → 8 skills (T35.G8.02, G8.03.01)

2. **Add 4 missing scaffolding skills**
   - T35.G2.05: Introduction to digital ethics tools (G2→G3 bridge)
   - T35.G5.05: Introduction to ethics frameworks (G5→G6 bridge)
   - T35.G6.03.00: Explore AI bias concepts (before G6 AI testing)
   - T35.G7.04.00: Research surveillance technology (before G7 simulator)

3. **Clarify 3 vague descriptions**
   - T35.G5.02: Add specifics about evidence sources
   - T35.G6.04: Add specifics about community action proposals
   - T35.G8.01.01: Complete the description

4. **Verify cross-topic dependencies**
   - Check T19.G5.01 doesn't violate X-2 rule
   - Confirm T22, T23, T24 progressions support T35 needs

### ESTIMATED IMPACT

**Before optimization:** 49 skills
**After splitting broad skills:** ~70 skills
**After adding scaffolding:** ~74 skills

**New skill distribution:**
- K: 4 skills
- G1: 4 skills
- G2: 5 skills (+1 bridge skill)
- G3: 4 skills
- G4: 5 skills
- G5: 5 skills (+1 framework intro)
- G6: 13 skills (+1 bias intro, +3 from splits)
- G7: 16 skills (+1 surveillance intro, +6 from splits)
- G8: 8 skills (+2 from splits)

### QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Clearer learning objectives** - Each skill focuses on one clear outcome
2. **Better scaffolding** - Smaller steps toward complex goals
3. **Easier assessment** - Teachers can evaluate specific competencies
4. **Reduced overwhelm** - Students tackle manageable chunks
5. **Maintained rigor** - Same content coverage, better organization

## CONCLUSION

T35 (Impacts & Ethics) is a well-structured topic with excellent K-5 progression and comprehensive AI ethics coverage in G6-G8. The main issues are overly broad skills in upper grades that try to accomplish too much in a single learning objective. By splitting 13 broad skills into more focused components and adding 4 scaffolding skills, the topic will maintain its comprehensive coverage while becoming more teachable and learnable.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive coverage of digital citizenship and AI ethics
- Excellent K-2 unplugged activities
- Strong integration with AI topics (T21-T24)
- Good thematic progression K-8
- No major duplicates or gaps

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Split overly broad G6-G8 skills into focused components
- Add introductory skills for major concept shifts
- Clarify vague descriptions
- Verify cross-topic dependency timing

**Overall Assessment:** STRONG topic requiring MODERATE restructuring in G6-G8 for optimal implementation.
