## KEY FINDINGS

### ✓ STRENGTHS

1. **Complete Coverage (95%)**
   - All 2D drawing blocks covered (rectangles, ovals, lines, pen)
   - All 3D primitives covered (spheres, boxes, cylinders)
   - Materials, textures, particles, lighting, post-processing all present
   - Data visualization progression from simple to multi-dimensional

2. **Excellent Scaffolding**
   - K-2: Picture-based/unplugged (4 skills per grade)
   - G3-5: Block coding with clear progression (6-7 skills per grade)
   - G6-8: Advanced concepts properly introduced (6-8 skills per grade)
   - No major jumps between grade levels
   - Proper bridge skills at all transitions

3. **Perfect Grade Appropriateness**
   - K-2: Visual, no text required, spatial reasoning
   - G3-5: Loops → variables → data → 3D introduction
   - G6-8: Efficiency, algorithms, multi-dimensional data all covered

4. **High IXL-Style Clarity**
   - All skills specific and assessable
   - Block names provided explicitly
   - Can all become practice exercises
   - Technical skills clearly marked

### ⚠ MINOR GAPS

1. **Extrusion** (Low Priority)
   - Mentioned in G7.05.03 but not explicitly introduced
   - Recommendation: Add G6.05.04 for explicit extrusion skill
   - Impact: Would improve path to custom vertex manipulation

2. **Advanced Texturing** (Very Low Priority)
   - Textures covered in G6.05.01 but could be more detailed
   - UV mapping, procedural textures not explicit
   - Impact: Minimal - basic coverage sufficient for K-8

## SKILL QUALITY SAMPLES

### Example 1: Technical Skill (G5.01)
**Skill:** Implement simple data-driven visualization

**Why Excellent:**
- Clearly marked as [Technical Skill]
- Specific chart types named: bar, line, scatter
- Blocks specified: draw rectangle/line/oval
- Iteration technique explained
- Can create 5+ practice exercises

### Example 2: Unplugged Skill (GK.02)
**Skill:** Order art steps with cards

**Why Excellent:**
- Picture-only (age appropriate)
- Clear action: drag-and-drop
- Observable outcome: matches finished page
- No text needed (explicitly stated)

### Example 3: Advanced Integration (G8.05)
**Skill:** Combine multiple algorithms in art pipeline

**Why Excellent:**
- Requires synthesis of multiple prior skills
- Specifies "two-phase pipeline"
- Includes explanation requirement
- Appropriate for G8 complexity

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Production Ready (No Changes Required)
T20 can be used as-is for curriculum development.

### Priority 2: Enhancement (Optional, Next Iteration)

1. **Add Extrusion Skill (G6.05.04)**
   - Fills minor gap between 3D curves and vertex manipulation
   - Low effort, medium impact

2. **Create Block Reference Document**
   - List all CreatiCode blocks by grade level
   - Helps teachers prepare lessons

3. **Create Assessment Rubrics**
   - Sample rubrics for technical skills
   - Approaching/Proficient/Advanced/Expert levels

## COMPARISON TO OTHER TOPICS

**T20 as Best Practice Example:**

What makes T20 exemplary:
- Every skill has proper dependencies
- Bridge skills at all major transitions
- Technical skills clearly marked
- Ethics/real-world analysis included (G8.03, G7.04)
- Progressive complexity without jumps
- Integration skills at G8 (pipeline, post-processing)

Other topics should emulate:
- The dependency chain structure
- The bridge skill approach (unplugged → coding)
- The technical skill marking
- The integration capstone pattern
