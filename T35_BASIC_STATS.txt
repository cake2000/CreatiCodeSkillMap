  Dependencies (1): T01.GK.01

T35.G1.04: Identify who to tell when uncomfortable online
  Description: Students match uncomfortable technology scenarios (mean message, scary image, stranger asking questions) with trusted adults who can help (parent, teacher, librarian).
  Dependencies (1): T35.G1.02

================================================================================
GRADE: G2 (4 skills)
================================================================================

T35.G2.01: Compare benefits and harms of a tech tool

For each card, they explain WHY the information is private or safe to share (e.g., "Home address is private because strangers could find where you live" or "Favorite color is safe because it doesn't help anyone locate you").
  Dependencies (1): T35.G2.01

================================================================================
GRADE: G3 (4 skills)
================================================================================

T35.G3.01: Evaluate digital footprints
  Description: Students create a project where typing a sample post (text input widget) displays a warning label if it contains common personal information keywords. Using if-blocks, they check for words like 'address', 'phone', 'school', 'live at' and display different warning messages (label widgets) for each type. Students test by categorizing 5 sample posts as 'safe to share' or 'reveals too much' based on which warnings appear.

  Description: Students build a simple moderated chat room using widget blocks (text input, labels, buttons) and AI moderation. They create a chat interface where users type messages into a text input widget. Before displaying messages in a label widget, the program uses ChatGPT AI moderation blocks to check for inappropriate content (spam, unkindness, PII). If content violates guidelines, a warning label appears instead. Students collaboratively write the guidelines that inform the AI moderation prompts.
  Dependencies (4): T35.G3.01, T08.G3.01, T16.G3.01, T22.G3.01

T35.G3.04: Recognize when apps collect data

T35.G4.02: Understand advertising/persuasion online
  Description: Students analyze actual CreatiCode community projects to identify persuasive design patterns (bright colors for "buy" buttons, countdown timers, celebrity endorsements in sprites). They create a project that demonstrates persuasive vs. informative design: two versions of the same app (e.g., a game invitation) where one uses persuasive tactics (flashing sprites, urgent language in labels) and one is neutral. Using widget blocks, they build both interfaces and have peers compare them, documenting which tactics they notice.
  Dependencies (2): T35.G3.02, T16.G4.01

T35.G4.03: Reflect on accessibility/inclusion in games
  Description: Students review a CreatiCode game for accessibility barriers. They test: (1) Can you understand it without sound? (Test by muting), (2) Can you see important elements? (Use sprite size/color blocks to adjust contrast), (3) Can you control it without a mouse? (Add keyboard controls using when key pressed blocks), (4) Can you understand instructions? (Add text-to-speech using AI Speaker blocks). Students document barriers found and implement at least one improvement to a sample game using blocks (e.g., adding keyboard controls or text-to-speech instructions).
  Dependencies (3): T35.G3.03, T06.G3.01, T22.G4.01

  Dependencies (2): T35.G6.02, T35.G5.02

T35.G7.04: Analyze societal impacts of AI perception technologies (Pairing with T23)
  Description: Students use CreatiCode's T23 perception blocks (hand detection, body pose tracking) to build a simple surveillance simulator. They create a project that: (1) Uses hand detection to count people entering a "virtual space" (tracking when hands appear/disappear), (2) Uses body pose detection to identify "suspicious" movements (e.g., running vs. walking based on joint distances), (3) Logs all detections to a table variable with timestamps. Students then analyze their own data log as a case study: What privacy information is captured? Could it discriminate (e.g., different walking styles for different abilities)? They debate surveillance tradeoffs and write ethical guidelines for when such systems are justified.
  Dependencies (3): T35.G6.02, T35.G6.03.01, T23.G7.01

T35.G7.05: Debate ethical implications of AI media generation (Pairing with T21)
