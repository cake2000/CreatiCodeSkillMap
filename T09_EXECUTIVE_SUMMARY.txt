Optimized skills: 73
Net increase: +12 skills (+19.7%)
Total transformations: 11

GRADE-BY-GRADE IMPACT
---------------------
Grade K:  2 →  2 (+0)  No changes
Grade 1:  2 →  2 (+0)  No changes
Grade 2:  2 →  2 (+0)  No changes
Grade 3:  9 → 11 (+2)  Split G3.02, added G3.01.05
Grade 4: 10 → 15 (+5)  Split G4.01, G4.02, G4.06 (BIGGEST IMPACT)
Grade 5:  9 → 10 (+1)  Added G5.03.01
Grade 6: 10 → 12 (+2)  Split G6.04, G6.05
Grade 7:  7 →  9 (+2)  Split G7.01.01
Grade 8: 10 → 10 (+0)  No changes

SKILLS SPLIT (8)
----------------
1. T09.G3.02   → 2 skills  (change vs reduce blocks)
2. T09.G4.01   → 2 skills  (addition vs subtraction)
3. T09.G4.02   → 2 skills  (multiplication vs division)
4. T09.G4.06   → 4 skills  (6 comparison operators) ⭐ HIGHEST IMPACT
5. T09.G6.04   → 2 skills  (string length vs case conversion)
6. T09.G6.05   → 2 skills  (position vs substring)
7. T09.G7.01.01 → 3 skills (5 math functions grouped logically)

SKILLS ADDED (2)
----------------
8. T09.G3.01.05 - Variable reporter blocks ⭐ CRITICAL GAP FILLED
   Purpose: Bridge between displaying variables and using in expressions

9. T09.G5.03.01 - Multi-input join with separator
   Purpose: Advanced string joining for CSV, formatted data

DEPENDENCIES FIXED (2)
----------------------
10. T09.G3.06 - Copy variable value
    Before: Depended on T09.G3.02 (change/reduce)
    After:  Depends on T09.G3.01.02 (set block)
    Reason: Copying uses "set", not "change"

11. T09.G4.05 - Use a variable as a loop counter
    Before: Only T07.G3.01 (loops)
    After:  Added T09.G3.01.04 (display) and T09.G3.02 (change)
    Reason: Loop counter needs variable display and increment

ALL 12 NEW SKILL IDs
--------------------
T09.G3.01.05  - Variable reporter blocks (NEW)
T09.G3.02.01  - Reduce block (split from G3.02)
T09.G4.01.01  - Subtraction operator (split from G4.01)
T09.G4.02.01  - Division operator (split from G4.02)
T09.G4.06.01  - Greater than operator (split from G4.06)
T09.G4.06.02  - Not equal operator (split from G4.06)
T09.G4.06.03  - Greater/less-or-equal operators (split from G4.06)
T09.G5.03.01  - Multi-input join (NEW)
T09.G6.04.01  - Case conversion (split from G6.04)
T09.G6.05.01  - Substring extraction (split from G6.05)
T09.G7.01.02  - Absolute value function (split from G7.01.01)
T09.G7.01.03  - Square root function (split from G7.01.01)
