- Binary decision-making (reasoning)
- Pattern recognition (how computers learn)
- Human vs. computer sensing
- Simple model building (e.g., decision trees for everyday choices)

### 2. "Under the Hood" Understanding
Current skills excel at using AI but could strengthen understanding of:
- How AI models are trained (the process, not just the concept)
- Data labeling and curation roles
- Different types of AI algorithms
- Why AI makes certain mistakes

### 3. Creative AI Building
Gap in skills where students actively build/train AI models from scratch:
- Training a classifier with custom data (3-5)
- Full ML pipeline experience (6-8)
