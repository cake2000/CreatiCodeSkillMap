## What to Implement

### Must Do (5 changes)
```
T34.G1.03: Update description (more specific)
T34.G2.02: Update description (add chart structure)
T34.G5.01: Update description (clarify scope)
T34.G6.01: Update description (remove prediction)
T34.G6.03: Update skill name + description (active verb)
```

### Should Do (2 changes)
```
T34.G5.04: Add new skill (programming languages)
T34.G6.02: Enhance description (UI evolution)
```

### Optional (2 changes)
```
T34.GK.04: Add new skill (sequence day) - LOW priority
T34.G3.01: Add CreatiCode mention - LOW priority
```

## Key Findings

### Strengths ✅
- Excellent K→8 progression
- Strong diversity focus (underrepresented innovators)
- Clean dependencies (no violations)
- K-2 appropriately unplugged
- Good knowledge + creation balance

### Gaps Identified ⚠️
- Programming language evolution (FILLED by G5.04)
- UI evolution only implicit (FILLED by G6.02 enhancement)

### No Critical Issues ✅
- No forward references
- No X-2 violations
- No circular dependencies
- No grade-inappropriate content

---

## Dependency Summary

**Internal**: 27 skills, clean structure, ~1.7 dependencies per skill average

**Cross-Topic** (preserve for Phase 2):
- T01.G1.01 (3 dependencies)
- T01.G1.10 (1 dependency)
- T03.G1.03 (1 dependency)

**Total cross-topic**: 4 dependencies (all appropriate)

---

## Content Coverage

### Before Optimization
❌ Programming languages
⚠️ UI evolution (implicit)
✅ Everything else

### After Optimization
✅ Programming languages (G5.04)
✅ UI evolution (G6.02)
✅ Everything else

---

## Grade Distribution

**Baseline**: 3 skills per grade (K-8) = 27 total

**After recommended**:
- K: 3, Grades 1-4: 3 each, **Grade 5: 4**, Grades 6-8: 3 each = **28 total**

**After all optional**:
- **K: 4**, Grades 1-4: 3 each, **Grade 5: 4**, Grades 6-8: 3 each = **29 total**

---

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Read T34_EXACT_CHANGES.md for specific text replacements
- [ ] Update 5 skill descriptions in allskills.md
- [ ] Add T34.G5.04 (programming languages) after T34.G5.03
- [ ] Enhance T34.G6.02 description (UI evolution)
- [ ] Optional: Add T34.GK.04 after T34.GK.03
- [ ] Optional: Enhance T34.G3.01 (CreatiCode mention)
- [ ] Validate using T34_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md
- [ ] Create final change summary

---

## Expected Outcomes

After implementation:
- ✅ All skills have clear, actionable descriptions
- ✅ Programming language history covered
- ✅ UI evolution explicitly addressed
- ✅ Consistent active verbs throughout
- ✅ No gaps in major computing history topics
- ✅ Ready for Phase 2 cross-topic review
