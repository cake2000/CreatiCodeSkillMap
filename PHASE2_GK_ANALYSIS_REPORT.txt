================================================================================
2. CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCY PATTERNS
================================================================================

Existing Cross-Topic Dependencies (14 patterns identified):

T02 → T01: 2 dependencies (Algorithm diagrams building on everyday algorithms)
T03 → T01: 1 dependency (Decomposition building on sequences)
T09 → T01: 1 dependency (Variables building on ordering concepts)
T10 → T01: 1 dependency (Lists building on ordering)
T13 → T01: 1 dependency (Debugging building on correct sequences)
T15 → T01: 1 dependency (Stories building on sequences)
T20 → T01: 1 dependency (Art building on sequences)
T20 → T04: 3 dependencies (Art building on patterns - GOOD!)
T35 → T01: 2 dependencies (Ethics building on practical examples)
T36 → T01: 1 dependency (Careers building on practical examples)

Observation: Most cross-topic dependencies appropriately connect to T01
(Everyday Algorithms) as the foundation. T20 (Art) has strong pattern
dependencies on T04. This shows good pedagogical structure.

================================================================================
3. X-2 RULE VALIDATION
================================================================================

Result: PERFECT COMPLIANCE

All 97 Grade K skills depend ONLY on Grade K skills.
No violations of the X-2 rule (grade level ± 2).

This is excellent - kindergarten skills are properly self-contained and
don't inappropriately depend on higher grade concepts.

================================================================================
4. CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

Result: NONE FOUND

No circular dependencies detected in the Grade K skill set.
The dependency graph is a proper DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

================================================================================
5. TRANSITIVE REDUNDANT DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

Found: 3 cases

IMPORTANT: Be CONSERVATIVE when removing these. Only remove if TRULY redundant.
When in doubt, KEEP the dependency.

Case 1: T02.GK.04 (Algorithm Diagrams)
  Skill: Move a card to fix the order in a flowchart
  Chain: T02.GK.04 → T02.GK.03 → T02.GK.02
  Redundant: T02.GK.04 → T02.GK.02 (direct dependency)

  RECOMMENDATION: REVIEW CAREFULLY
  - This is a 3-skill sequence: matching (02) → picking (03) → fixing (04)
  - The direct 04→02 might be pedagogically valuable even if transitive
  - DECISION: Keep unless you determine 03 fully covers 02's concepts

Case 2: T24.GK.03 (AI Practices)
  Skill: Predict which "helper" is better for the job
  Chain: T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.02 → T24.GK.01
  Redundant: T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.01 (direct dependency)

  RECOMMENDATION: Consider removing T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.01
  - This appears to be a clear sequence: identify AI (01) → know tasks (02) → predict best (03)
  - The transitive dependency through 02 should be sufficient
  - DECISION: Likely safe to remove direct 03→01 dependency

Case 3: T29.GK.03 (Text Data & NLP)
  Skill: Sort cards by text vs no text
  Chain: T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.02 → T29.GK.01
  Redundant: T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.01 (direct dependency)

  RECOMMENDATION: Consider removing T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.01
  - Clear sequence: recognize text (01) → find text (02) → sort by text (03)
  - The transitive dependency through 02 should be sufficient
  - DECISION: Likely safe to remove direct 03→01 dependency

================================================================================
6. MISSING CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (3 dependencies to add):

1. T14.GK.01: Match controls to character actions
   ADD DEPENDENCY: T06.GK.01 (Order pictures showing morning routine - events)
   REASON: Understanding game controls requires understanding events
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: None (foundational)

   JUSTIFICATION: Games respond to player input (events). Students need to
   understand that actions happen in response to triggers before they can
   connect controls to character actions.

2. T14.GK.02: Recognize a score in simple games
   ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.GK.01 (Recognize that a label can hold a number)
   REASON: Understanding score requires understanding variables/labels
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: None (foundational)

   JUSTIFICATION: A score is essentially a variable that holds a number.
   Students should understand what numbers in labels mean before recognizing
   scores in games.

3. T13.GK.02: Retry after noticing something went wrong
   ADD DEPENDENCY: T01.GK.01 (Put pictures in order for getting ready for bed)
   REASON: Debugging requires understanding correct sequences first
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T13.GK.01

   JUSTIFICATION: To know something went wrong, students need to know what
   "right" looks like. Basic sequencing skills are foundational to debugging.

MEDIUM PRIORITY (3 dependencies to add):

4. T26.GK.01: Identify countable things in a picture
   ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.GK.01 (Recognize that a label can hold a number)
   REASON: Data counting builds on understanding numbers and counting
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: None (foundational)

   JUSTIFICATION: Counting for data purposes is an application of number
   concepts. Students should understand what numbers represent first.

5. T26.GK.02: Use tokens to log repeated events
   ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.GK.01 (Recognize that a label can hold a number)
   REASON: Logging/counting events requires number concepts
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T26.GK.01

   JUSTIFICATION: Similar to above - this builds on number understanding.
   Note: This skill already depends on T26.GK.01, so this creates a path
   T26.GK.02 → T26.GK.01 → T09.GK.01

6. T27.GK.01: Sort objects by a rule and explain it
   ADD DEPENDENCY: T10.GK.01 (Sort picture cards into groups)
   REASON: Data sorting builds on general sorting/grouping concepts
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: None (foundational)

   JUSTIFICATION: Data analysis sorting is a specific application of general
   sorting. Students should understand basic grouping first. Both skills are
   about sorting, but T10.GK.01 is more general and T27.GK.01 applies it to
   data analysis context.

================================================================================
7. WITHIN-TOPIC DEPENDENCY GAPS
================================================================================

Found: 7 potential gaps to review

These are skills that come later in their topic sequence but have no
dependencies on earlier skills in the same topic. Review each to determine
if a within-topic dependency is needed.

1. T03.GK.03: Order 3-4 pictures to show steps in a routine
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T03.GK.01
   POTENTIAL GAP: Could also depend on T03.GK.02 (Name parts of a project)
   REVIEW: Is T03.GK.02 necessary for T03.GK.03? Or is T03.GK.01 sufficient?

2. T10.GK.05: Find the first and last item in a row
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T01.GK.03
   POTENTIAL GAP: This is item #5 but has no dependency on T10.GK.01-04
   REVIEW: Should it depend on T10.GK.04 or earlier T10 skills?
   NOTE: It depends on T01.GK.03 (Find first/last pictures), so the concept
   is covered cross-topic. This might be intentional.

3. T20.GK.02: Order art steps with cards
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T01.GK.01
   POTENTIAL GAP: Could depend on T20.GK.01 (Make a pattern with colors)
   REVIEW: Are these parallel foundational art skills, or does 02 build on 01?

4. T20.GK.03: Continue the pattern trail
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T04.GK.01
   POTENTIAL GAP: Could depend on T20.GK.02
   REVIEW: Does continuing a pattern need ordering skills first?

5. T20.GK.04: Fix the mixed-up art plan (picture-only)
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T04.GK.01
   POTENTIAL GAP: Could depend on T20.GK.03 or T20.GK.02
   REVIEW: Does fixing require the prior art skills?

6. T35.GK.02: Recognize signs of too much screen time
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T01.GK.01
   POTENTIAL GAP: Could depend on T35.GK.01 (Identify helpful use of tech)
   REVIEW: Should students first understand helpful uses before recognizing
   too much use?

7. T35.GK.03: Practice device sharing etiquette
   CURRENT DEPENDENCIES: T01.GK.01
   POTENTIAL GAP: Could depend on T35.GK.02
   REVIEW: Is sharing etiquette independent of screen time concepts?

RECOMMENDATION: Review each gap individually. Some may be intentional parallel
tracks within a topic. Focus on whether the pedagogical progression requires
the earlier skill or if the cross-topic dependency is sufficient.

================================================================================
8. GRADE-LEVEL COHERENCE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Foundational Skills (no dependencies): 31 skills (32%)
- This is healthy - about 1/3 of skills are entry points
- Good distribution across topics (most topics have 1-2 foundational skills)
- Shows topics are accessible to true beginners

Advanced Skills (3+ dependencies): 0 skills
- No Grade K skills have 3 or more dependencies
- This is appropriate for kindergarten level
- Maximum is 2 dependencies, keeping complexity low

Dependency Depth Distribution:
- Depth 0 (foundational): 31 skills (32%)
- Depth 1 (1 step from foundation): 41 skills (42%)
- Depth 2 (2 steps from foundation): 22 skills (23%)
- Depth 3 (3 steps from foundation): 2 skills (2%)
- Depth 4 (4 steps from foundation): 1 skill (1%)

ASSESSMENT: Excellent distribution. Most skills are at depth 0-1, meaning
they're very close to foundational concepts. Only 3 skills reach depth 3-4,
which is appropriate for a kindergarten curriculum.

Skill Complexity:
- Grade K skills are appropriately simple and concrete
- Heavy use of pictures, matching, ordering, recognition tasks
- Minimal abstract concepts
- Hands-on, visual learning focus

ASSESSMENT: Skills are age-appropriate for kindergarten. They focus on
concrete, visual tasks rather than abstract concepts.

================================================================================
10. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED FIXES
================================================================================

CRITICAL (Must Fix):
None - no critical issues found

HIGH PRIORITY (Strongly Recommend):
1. Add T06.GK.01 as dependency of T14.GK.01 (game controls need events)
2. Add T09.GK.01 as dependency of T14.GK.02 (game score needs variables)
3. Add T01.GK.01 as dependency of T13.GK.02 (debugging needs sequences)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Consider Adding):
4. Add T09.GK.01 as dependency of T26.GK.01 (data counting needs numbers)
5. Add T09.GK.01 as dependency of T26.GK.02 (data logging needs numbers)
6. Add T10.GK.01 as dependency of T27.GK.01 (data sorting needs grouping)

LOW PRIORITY (Review and Decide):
7. Review and possibly remove T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.01 (transitive redundancy)
8. Review and possibly remove T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.01 (transitive redundancy)
9. Review T02.GK.04 → T02.GK.02 (may or may not be redundant)
10. Review 7 within-topic dependency gaps (see section 7)

TOTAL CHANGES: 3 high priority additions, 3 medium priority additions,
               up to 2-3 redundancy removals, 7 gap reviews

================================================================================
11. PEDAGOGICAL OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

Strengths:
1. T01 (Everyday Algorithms) serves as excellent foundation for many topics
2. Strong pattern recognition through T04, properly connected to T20 (Art)
3. Age-appropriate complexity - skills are concrete and visual
4. Good topic diversity - covers CS concepts, AI, data, ethics, safety
5. No circular dependencies - clean learning progressions
6. Excellent X-2 compliance - all skills at appropriate grade level

Areas for Enhancement:
1. Game skills (T14) could better connect to foundational concepts (events, variables)
2. Data skills (T26, T27) could better connect to number and sorting concepts
3. Some within-topic progressions could be strengthened
4. A few transitive redundancies to clean up

Overall Assessment:
The Grade K skill set is well-designed and age-appropriate. The dependency
structure is strong with only minor gaps. The recommended fixes are modest
enhancements rather than major corrections. This indicates good initial design.

================================================================================
12. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
================================================================================

When applying fixes:

1. Add dependencies liberally - it's better to have more prerequisites than
   to miss critical foundations

2. Be conservative removing redundancies - only remove if you're CERTAIN
   the transitive path covers all necessary prerequisite knowledge

3. Review within-topic gaps case-by-case - some may be intentional parallel
   tracks within a topic area

4. Do NOT change skill IDs - only modify dependency lists

5. Test the impact of each change - does it make the learning path clearer?

6. Consider the pedagogical sequence - does the dependency match how you'd
   actually teach these concepts?

7. Maintain the balance - keep kindergarten skills at kindergarten complexity
