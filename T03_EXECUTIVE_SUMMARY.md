# T03 Skills - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-22
**Topic:** T03 - Problem Decomposition
**Verification Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Quick Summary

**ALL 50 T03 SKILLS ARE IN PERFECT CONDITION**

- ✅ **0 X-2 rule violations**
- ✅ **0 circular dependencies**
- ✅ **0 illogical dependencies**
- ✅ **100% skills passing all checks**

---

## What Was Verified

Every single T03 skill from **T03.GK.01** through **T03.G8.06** was extracted and analyzed for:

1. **X-2 Rule Compliance**
   - Grade 3+ skills cannot depend on Kindergarten skills
   - Grade 4+ skills cannot depend on Grade 1 skills
   - Grade 5+ skills cannot depend on Grade 2 skills

2. **Circular Dependencies**
   - No skill can depend on itself through any chain

3. **Illogical Dependencies**
   - All cross-topic dependencies must be appropriate
   - Dependencies must follow logical progression

4. **Proper Progression**
   - Skills must build on previous grades appropriately

### X-2 Rule Compliance

| Grade Level | Skills Checked | Violations | Status |
|-------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| Grade 3+ (no GK deps) | 37 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| Grade 4+ (no G1 deps) | 30 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| Grade 5+ (no G2 deps) | 23 | 0 | ✅ PASS |

### Cross-Topic Dependencies

Total cross-topic dependencies: **19**
All are logically appropriate and respect X-2 rule.

| Topic | Count | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| T01 (Sequencing) | 1 | Foundation for ordering |
| T02 (Algorithms) | 2 | Flowchart and architecture visualization |
| T04 (Patterns) | 1 | Pattern recognition in systems |
| T06 (Events) | 8 | Implementation context |
| T07 (Loops) | 1 | Implementation knowledge |
| T08 (Conditionals) | 1 | Implementation knowledge |
| T09 (Variables) | 5 | Data management context |

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Perfect X-2 compliance** across all 50 skills
2. **Clean dependency graph** with no circular references
3. **Logical progression** from simple part-whole concepts to complex refactoring
4. **Appropriate cross-topic integration** with implementation topics (T06-T09)
5. **Balanced distribution** across grade levels

### Notable Patterns
1. **T06.G3.01** is the most referenced cross-topic skill (7 dependencies)
2. **T03.G4.01** and **T03.G5.01** are key internal hub skills (7 dependencies each)
3. **Grade 3 is a pivot grade** - introduces practical implementation context
4. **Strong internal cohesion** - 66% of dependencies are within T03
