# Critical Pathways: Recommended Learning Sequences

**Five major learning journeys through the K-8 skill map**

---

## Overview

While the skill map offers 1,155 skills across 36 topics, students don't learn in isolation. This guide shows five **critical pathways** - coherent sequences of skills that build on each other to achieve major learning goals.

**How to use this:**
1. Choose a pathway that matches your school's emphasis
2. Use the skill sequence and prerequisite chains
3. Integrate with your curriculum and tools
4. Adapt based on your specific needs

## Pathway 1: Bridge to Coding (K-3)

### Goal
Move students from unplugged algorithmic thinking to their first coded programs.

### Target Grades
Kindergarten - Grade 3

### Why This Pathway?
This pathway bridges the critical gap between natural, everyday problem-solving and formal computer programming. It ensures students have a solid foundation in algorithmic thinking before they encounter programming syntax.

### Skill Sequence

#### Phase 1: Foundations (K-1)
**Duration**: Fall of Grade 1

**Core Skills**:
1. T01.G1.01 - Write or draw steps for a simple task
2. T02.G1.01 - Follow simple arrows or directions
3. T04.G1.01 - Find repeating patterns
4. T05.G1.01 - Think about who the user is

**Activities**:
- Morning routine: order picture cards
- Treasure hunts: follow arrow directions
- Pattern creation: with blocks, colors, sounds
- Feedback circles: ask classmates what they think

**Project**: "My Morning Sequence" - order 5 pictures of morning activities

#### Phase 2: Complexity (G2)
**Duration**: Grades 1-2, full year

**Core Skills**:
1. T01.G2.01 - Write an algorithm with "if/then" choice
2. T01.G2.02 - Write an algorithm with a repeat statement
3. T07.G2.01 - Use a simple repeat/loop
4. T08.G2.01 - Use "if/then" in a sequence
5. T06.G2.01 - Recognize events and sequences

**Activities**:
- Flowchart puzzles with branching
- Simon Says with repeat counts
- "Weather algorithm" - if sunny, bring sunglasses; if rainy, bring umbrella
- Unplugged Beebots (if available)

**Project**: "Decision Tree Algorithm" - create instructions for a friend considering two different scenarios

#### Phase 3: Transition to Code (G3, First Half)
**Duration**: Fall of Grade 3

**Critical Step**: Introduce a block-based coding tool (Scratch, Blockly, CreatiCode)

**Core Skills**:
1. T06.G3.01 - Build a simple sequence with a tool
2. T06.G3.02 - Understand events trigger actions
3. T07.G3.01 - Use a repeat loop to move a character
4. T08.G2.01 (review) - If/then thinking

**Activities**:
- First program: "Hello World" - make a character say hello
- Movement animation: use loops to move character
- Event understanding: click triggers action
- Debugging: fix broken programs

**Project**: "Interactive Character" - create a character that responds to different events (click, key press, etc.)

#### Phase 4: Coding Foundation (G3, Second Half)
**Duration**: Spring of Grade 3

**Core Skills**:
1. T07.G3.01 - Use repeat loops (depth)
2. T08.G3.01 - Use if/else in code
3. T09.G3.01 - Use different variable types
4. T09.G3.02 - Store values in variables

**Activities**:

- Conditional logic: make decisions in code
- Variables: store and update player name, score

**Project**: "Simple Interactive Game" - basic game with rules, scoring, and movement

### Key Milestones

| Grade | Milestone | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| G1 | Understands sequences | Can order 5+ step process |
| G2 | Understands branching | Can write if/then algorithm |
| G2 | Understands loops | Can use "repeat X times" |
| G3 | Writes first program | Can create 10+ block sequence |
| G3 | Uses loops in code | Program uses at least one loop |

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Students confused by abstract symbols/blocks
**Solution**: Use "unplugged blocks" (physical paper blocks) before coding tool

**Challenge**: Syntax errors frustrate students
**Solution**: Use block-based, not text-based, languages at this stage

**Challenge**: Too fast transition from concrete to abstract
**Solution**: Spend 6+ weeks on unplugged activities before coding
