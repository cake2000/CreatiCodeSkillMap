#### Group 2: Split Complex Skills (6 skills → 12 sub-skills)

Six overly complex skills were split into clear, focused sub-skills:

✅ **T35.G4.03** → **T35.G4.03.01 + T35.G4.03.02**
- .01: Test game accessibility features (widget checklist, barrier documentation)
- .02: Implement accessibility improvements (keyboard, TTS, contrast, settings)
- 2 skills updated to reference new IDs

✅ **T35.G6.03** → **T35.G6.03.01 + T35.G6.03.02 + T35.G6.03.03**
- .01: Test AI content generation tools (T21-T22) with systematic documentation
- .02: Synthesize comprehensive AI ethics guidelines from test data
- .03: Develop ethics guidelines for AI perception (T23-T24) - formerly .01
- 5 skills updated to reference new structure

✅ **T35.G6.05** → **T35.G6.05.01 + T35.G6.05.02**
- .01: Build consent form and data collection
- .02: Implement data viewing and deletion controls
- Sequential dependencies properly set up

✅ **T35.G7.04** → **T35.G7.04.01 + T35.G7.04.02**

- .02: Apply tool to evaluate AI projects (3+ projects, comparative analysis)

#### Group 3: Sub-Skill Numbering

✅ **Preserved hierarchical numbering** (.01.01, .03.01 patterns)
- Decision made to keep semantically meaningful parent-child relationships
- Renumbering would cause cascading dependency updates with no pedagogical benefit
- Examples: T35.G7.01.01, T35.G8.01.01 are genuine sub-skills of parent skills

## Cross-Topic Integration Strengths

**Strong Dependencies On**:
- **T16 (Widgets)**: Used extensively G3-G8 for interactive demonstrations
- **T21-T24 (AI)**: Core to G6-G8 AI ethics curriculum
- **T19 (Data Storage)**: Essential for data collection and privacy skills
- **T08/T09 (Conditionals/Variables)**: Foundation for G3-G4 interactive projects
- **T01 (Algorithms)**: Foundation for K-2 unplugged activities

**Skills That Depend On T35**:
- Other topics reference T35 for ethical considerations in their own contexts
- These cross-topic dependencies were all preserved (Phase 2 will verify consistency)

---

## Outstanding LOW Priority Issues

**10 skills with long descriptions (>500 chars)**:
- Most are complex G6-G8 skills where length is justified
- Can be addressed in future polish phase if needed
- Does not affect functionality or pedagogy

**Possible future additions**:
- Cybersecurity ethics (beyond current G2.03, G3.01)
- Environmental impact of computing
- AI governance and regulation
- Economic impacts of automation

These are suggestions for future enhancement, not critical gaps.
