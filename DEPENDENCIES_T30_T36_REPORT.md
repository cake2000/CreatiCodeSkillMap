## Key Dependency Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Within Topics
All T30-T36 topics follow progression: G1 (foundational) → G8 (synthesis)

**Characteristics**:
- G1 skills are entry points (no prerequisites)
- Each grade typically depends on previous grade's first skill
- Allows flexible pacing within topics

### Pattern 2: Programming Dependencies (Lighter Than Core)
T30-T36 are conceptual domains, but practical skills require prior programming:

| Topic | Primary Programming Dependency | Grade |
|-------|--------------------------------|-------|
| T30 | T06.G1-G2 (basic programs) | G2-3+ |
| T31 | T06.G1-G2 (if hands-on) | G2+ |
| T32 | T09.G2-G3 (variables for passwords) | G2-3 |
| T33 | **T06.G3+ (critical)**, T11 (functions) | G3-5 |
| T34 | T05 (design thinking context) | G4+ |
| T35 | Application topics T14-T24 | G4-5+ |
| T36 | T12 (code organization) | G4+ |

### Pattern 3: Ethical Integration Pathway
**T32 (Security) → T35 (Impacts) → T36 (Ethics/Responsibility)**

This three-topic pathway creates coherent "Responsible Computing" education:

1. **T32**: Understand security needs and threats
2. **T35**: Understand broader societal impacts
3. **T36**: Apply ethical frameworks and responsibility

**Grade Alignment**:
- G1-4: Foundation in each topic
- G5-6: Integration begins (T33 with ethics, T35 with applications)
- G7-8: Full synthesis (T32.G7-8 security ethics, T35.G7-8 impacts, T36.G7-8 responsibility)

### Pattern 4: AI Ethics Integration
**T21-T24 (AI topics) ← T32, T35, T36**

All three systems/ethics topics connect to AI:
- T32 (security of AI systems)
- T35 (impacts of AI)
- T36 (ethical AI development)

Critical connection: **T28.G8.03** "Analyzing bias in AI models" bridges statistics to AI ethics

### Pattern 5: Applications Inform Impact Understanding
- T14-T20 (applications) → T35 (impacts) → T36 (responsibility)
- T21-T24 (AI applications) → T35.G6 (AI impacts) → T36.G6 (AI ethics)
