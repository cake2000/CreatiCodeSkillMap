GRADE 2 CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCY RECOMMENDATIONS (T12-T20)
================================================================================

T12.G2.02: Add dependency T01.G1.01 - Reason: Understanding sequences is needed before labeling sections of a plan
T13.G2.01: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: Understanding signals/events requires conditional thinking (if signal X then action Y)
T13.G2.04: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: Adding checks requires conditional thinking (if goal reached then show success)
T14.G2.02: Add dependency T02.G1.01 - Reason: Tracking lives requires understanding of counting and data tracking
T14.G2.03: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: Level progression requires conditional logic (if goal touched then next level)
T15.G2.01: Add dependency T04.G1.01 - Reason: Understanding animation speed requires recognizing patterns in movement sequences
T15.G2.02: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: Scene transitions are conditional changes (if location changes then new scene)
T15.G2.03: Add dependency T04.G2.01 - Reason: Identifying repeating animation patterns requires pattern recognition skills
T15.G2.03: Add dependency T07.G1.01 - Reason: Understanding loops in animation requires loop concept understanding
T16.G2.01: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: UI interactions are conditional (if button pressed then action happens)
T16.G2.02: Add dependency T05.G1.01 - Reason: Designing interfaces requires understanding of composition and character/element needs
T18.G2.01: Add dependency T17.G1.01 - Reason: Understanding 3D viewpoints builds on 2D motion and direction concepts
T20.G2.01: Add dependency T04.G1.01 - Reason: Using repeat in art requires understanding of pattern recognition
T20.G2.02: Add dependency T04.G1.02 - Reason: Creating symmetrical patterns requires understanding of pattern structures
T20.G2.03: Add dependency T04.G2.02 - Reason: Layering patterns requires recognizing repeated sequences
T20.G2.04: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: Predicting changes requires conditional thinking (if color changes then pattern looks different)
