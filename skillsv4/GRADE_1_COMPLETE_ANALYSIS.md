- T12.G1.03 → T03.GK.01
- T15.G1.01 → T03.GK.02
- T20.G1.02 → T03.GK.02
- T23.G1.02 → T03.GK.02
- T36.G1.03 → T03.GK.01

#### From T04 (Pattern Recognition) - 1 dependency
- T13.G1.03 → T04.GK.02

## Insights and Recommendations

### Strengths
1. **Clear progression within topics**: Most skills build upon earlier skills in the same topic
2. **No broken dependencies**: All 124 dependencies reference valid existing skills
3. **Logical skill chains**: Skills form clear learning progressions

### Potential Issues
1. **T01.GK.01 is heavily relied upon**: 9 cross-topic dependencies on a single Grade K skill
   - Consider whether this skill should be reinforced or split
2. **Only 2 skills have no dependencies**: T01.G1.09 and T31.G1.01
   - Verify if these truly need no prerequisites
3. **Minimal G1-to-G1 cross-topic dependencies**: Only 1 instance (T09.G1.01 → T03.G1.01)
   - This suggests topics are relatively independent at G1 level

### Next Steps
1. Review the 22 skills with cross-topic dependencies for potential optimization
2. Consider if T01.GK.01 should be a universal prerequisite or if dependencies should be diversified
3. Validate that the 2 skills with no dependencies are appropriate entry points
4. Analyze Grade 2 skills to see if cross-grade dependencies increase
