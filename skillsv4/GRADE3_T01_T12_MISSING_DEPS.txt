# Analysis Date: 2025-11-24
# Scope: Grade 3 skills only, following X-2 rule

## RECOMMENDED NEW DEPENDENCIES TO ADD

T04.G3.04.02: Create a custom block (template) for repeated code patterns
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Uses parameters/variables as placeholders in custom blocks

T04.G3.08: Match algorithm descriptions to code pattern shapes
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Matches patterns like "count how many times" which use counter variables

T12.G3.03.01: Use clearer variable names to improve readability
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Naming variables requires understanding of variables

T12.G3.03.04: Combine similar consecutive blocks
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Examples include "change score by 1" - works with variables

T02.G3.04: Trace a block sequence with an if/else decision
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Explicitly traces scripts with if/else blocks

T02.G3.05: Create a block script with one if/else decision
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Explicitly creates scripts with if/else blocks

T01.G3.16: Identify when to use 'repeat forever' vs 'repeat N times'
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Example mentions "checking if a key is pressed" which uses conditionals
