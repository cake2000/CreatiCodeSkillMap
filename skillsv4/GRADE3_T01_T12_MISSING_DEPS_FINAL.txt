# GRADE 3 CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCY RECOMMENDATIONS (T01-T12)
# FINAL ANALYSIS - Manually verified against actual skill descriptions
# Only includes MISSING dependencies that should be ADDED

T04.G3.04.02: Create a custom block (template) for repeated code patterns
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Uses parameters/variables as placeholders in custom blocks

T04.G3.08: Match algorithm descriptions to code pattern shapes
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Matches patterns like "count how many times" which use counter variables

T08.G3.05: Fix a condition that uses the wrong comparison operator
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Comparison operators typically compare variables or values

T12.G3.03.01: Use clearer variable names to improve readability
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Renaming variables requires understanding of variables
