## New Grade 5 Sequence

The Grade 5 skills are now in the correct pedagogical order:

1. **T22.G5.01** - Flag risky vs safe chatbot prompts (safety first)
2. **T22.G5.02** - Observe chatbot strengths and weaknesses (testing)
3. **T22.G5.03** - Experiment with prompt phrasing (optimization)
4. **T22.G5.04** - **Use a chatbot block to get AI responses** (FOUNDATION - was T22.G5.1.5)
5. **T22.G5.05** - Identify ChatGPT block parameters (was T22.G5.04)

**Rationale**: Students must learn to USE the chatbot block (#4) before they can identify its parameters (#5).
