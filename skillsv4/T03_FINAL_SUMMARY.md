**Key Achievement:** T03 now has complete scaffolding from Grade K through Grade 8 with clear, assessable skills and proper dependencies.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. NEW SKILLS ADDED (2 skills)

#### T03.GK.05 - "Describe what each step accomplishes"
- **Placement:** End of Grade K
- **Purpose:** Bridges K→G1 gap from ordering steps to understanding functional roles
- **Description:** Students look at each step in a familiar routine and select or describe what it does or what changes after that step
- **Dependencies:** T03.GK.03
- **Impact:** Provides critical scaffolding for transition to Grade 1 functional thinking

#### T03.G5.06 - "Identify modules in example projects"
- **Placement:** End of Grade 5
- **Purpose:** Bridges G5→G6 gap by introducing module concept before asking students to propose them
- **Description:** Students examine example projects and identify logical modules (groups of related components working together)
- **Dependencies:** T03.G5.01
- **Impact:** Prevents G6 students from being asked to propose modules without understanding what they are

---

### 2. SKILLS ENHANCED (10 skills)

#### High Priority Enhancements (7 skills)

**T03.G3.03, T03.G3.04, T03.G3.05** - Added coding project context
- **Issue:** G3 storyboard skills were too abstract
- **Fix:** Explicitly connected to students' own coding projects
- **Impact:** Ensures Grade 3+ skills involve actual block-based coding work

**T03.G5.04** - Clarified vagueness criteria
- **Issue:** "Unclear tasks" was undefined
- **Fix:** Added specific criteria (missing acceptance criteria, undefined scope) with concrete examples
- **Example:** Changed from vague "make AI" to specific "enemy follows player when within 5 steps"

**T03.G7.04** - Specified planning problem types
- **Issue:** "Planning problem" was too vague
- **Fix:** Listed specific problems: duplicated functionality, tangled dependencies, unclear boundaries
- **Impact:** Students know exactly what to look for

**T03.G8.05** - Defined structural problem indicators
- **Issue:** "Messy project" was subjective
- **Fix:** Specified concrete problems: duplicated code, unclear responsibilities, tight coupling
- **Impact:** Made skill objectively assessable

**T03.G4.05** - Emphasized completeness focus
- **Issue:** Overlap with T03.G5.04 (both critique tasks)
- **Fix:** Clarified G4 focuses on plan completeness, G5 on task clarity
- **Impact:** Clear differentiation between skills

#### Medium Priority Enhancements (3 skills)

**T03.G3.06** - Defined "logical components"
- **Fix:** Added examples (Player Control manages input, Game Logic manages rules, UI shows information)
- **Impact:** Students understand what makes a component "logical"

**T03.G4.02** - Specified grouping criteria
- **Fix:** Added criteria: shared data, similar purpose, communication patterns
- **Impact:** Clear basis for grouping decisions

**T03.G5.05** - Clarified difference from T03.G3.05
- **Fix:** G3 focuses on logical sequence, G5 on detailed evaluation with cited differences
- **Impact:** Eliminated overlap confusion

---

### 3. DEPENDENCIES FIXED (2 additions)

**T03.G4.05** - Added dependency on T03.G4.04
- **Issue:** Missing connection to task list creation skill
- **Fix:** Now depends on both T03.G3.05 (choose plan) and T03.G4.04 (task lists)
- **Impact:** Proper skill progression

**T03.G6.04** - Added dependency on T03.G4.06
- **Issue:** Both skills involve updating plans, but no connection
- **Fix:** Now references earlier plan-updating skill for consistency
- **Impact:** Reinforces iterative planning progression

## What Was NOT Changed (By Design)

### Intentionally Preserved
- ❌ **No skills deleted** - Only improvements made
- ❌ **No cross-topic dependencies removed** - All preserved for Phase 2
- ❌ **No skills from other topics modified** - Only T03 touched
- ❌ **Original structure maintained** - IDs, formatting unchanged
- ❌ **Borderline skills kept** - T03.G2.04 (tracking), T03.G7.05-06 (testing) remain as they support decomposition understanding

---

## Low Priority Items (Deferred)

These items were identified but not implemented as they are optional optimizations:

1. **Split T03.G7.01** into 2-3 smaller skills (architecture is complex but manageable as-is)
2. **Split T03.G6.02** into separate duplication/reuse skills (overlap acceptable)
3. **Split T03.G8.01** specification skill (comprehensive spec appropriate for Grade 8)
4. **XO prerequisite verification** (requires checking T01/T02, deferred to Phase 2)

---

## Files Modified

1. **skillsv4/allskills.md** - T03 section (lines 1370-1850 approx)
   - 2 new skills added
   - 10 skills enhanced
   - 2 dependencies added
   - All formatting preserved

2. **skillsv4/T03_changes_summary.md** - Detailed analysis report (created by subagent)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

When Phase 2 begins, the following inter-topic issues can be reviewed:

1. **Cross-topic dependency optimization** - Review all T03 dependencies on T01, T02, T04, T06, T07, T08, T09
2. **XO introduction verification** - Confirm XO is properly introduced before T03.G6.05
3. **Coding topic alignment** - Verify T06, T07, T08, T09 dependencies match actual skill progression
4. **Testing topic decision** - Determine if testing skills (T03.G7.05-06) should move to dedicated testing topic

The topic demonstrates:
- Clear, assessable skills with concrete criteria
- Complete scaffolding from kindergarten through grade 8
- Proper internal dependencies with no violations
- Strong alignment with problem decomposition theme
