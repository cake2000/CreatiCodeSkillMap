## GRADE 3 - Block Coding Begins

## T10.G3.01: Create a list and add items to it

Students create a new list variable (e.g., "fruits" or "scores") and use the `add [item] to [list]` block to add 3-4 items one at a time. They check the "show list" option to see the list monitor on stage and understand that a list holds multiple values in order. This is the foundational skill for all list operations.

**Dependencies:**

## T10.G4.07: Find the maximum or minimum item in a list manually

Students write a loop to find the largest or smallest item in a numeric list without using built-in blocks.

- T09.G3.01.04: Display variable value on stage using the variable monitor

**CSTA:** E4-ALG-AF-01

## GRADE 8 - Advanced Algorithms and Data Relationships

## T10.G8.01: Use nested loops to compare data across two tables

**CSTA:** MS-DAA-DP-05

## T10.G8.02: Implement bubble sort algorithm step by step

Students implement bubble sort by writing nested loops: the outer loop controls passes, the inner loop compares adjacent items and swaps if out of order. They trace through the algorithm to understand how items "bubble" to their correct positions.
