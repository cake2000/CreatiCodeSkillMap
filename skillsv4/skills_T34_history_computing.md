# T34 – Computing History: K–8 Skill List (Draft v2)

Topic reference: `T34 Computing History` in `domains_topics_overview.md`
Domain: Computing & Society (D5) · CSTA focus: CAS‑HC (History of Computing)

Each skill below has:

- a stable **ID** (`T34.G<grade>.<nn>`),
- an IXL-style **short name**,
- a **description** (what understanding/behavior it targets),
- a **challenge format** (the typical problem type to assess it).

Where relevant, a primary **CSTA code** is noted.

**Role and scope in v3:** T34 helps students see their projects as part of a long story—diverse inventors, shifting hardware platforms, and evolving social impacts. K–2 focus on recognizing change over time and naming people who use technology. Grades 3–5 build timelines, connect inventions to daily life, and highlight contributions from global innovators. Grades 6–8 analyze trends (AI waves, networking, accessibility), evaluate equity issues, and produce research artifacts that inform ethics work (T35) and platform choices (T30). Each grade’s tasks mirror age-appropriate social studies skills (compare/contrast, cause/effect, primary sources).
