Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Design a coordinated set of 3-5 custom blocks for one game feature
Description: Students design and implement exactly 3-5 related custom blocks that work together to implement ONE specific game feature or subsystem. Examples: a "Health System" (blocks for taking damage, healing, checking if alive), a "Score System" (blocks for adding points, multipliers, displaying score), or a "Movement System" (blocks for walking, jumping, collision detection). The blocks must have consistent naming patterns, complementary parameters, and clear division of responsibilities. Students document how the blocks work together and demonstrate the complete feature working in a game.

Assessment example: Students create a "Inventory System" with blocks `AddItem (item)`, `RemoveItem (item)`, `HasItem (item)`, `ShowInventory`, and `ClearInventory`. They demonstrate these blocks working together in a simple collection game.

ID: T11.G7.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand encapsulation and information hiding
Description: Students understand the principle of encapsulation: a well-designed custom block acts like a "black box" where users only need to know WHAT it does (its interface: name, parameters, return value) and not HOW it does it (the implementation inside). They compare examples of blocks with clear, self-contained interfaces versus blocks that require users to know internal details (like specific variable names used inside). This "information hiding" principle makes code easier to use, understand, and modify, because changes to the internal implementation won't break code that calls the block.

Topic: T15 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Scene manager sprite
Description: Create a dedicated "SceneManager" sprite (use `hide` to keep it invisible) that centralizes story flow control. Store the current scene in a variable: `set [currentScene v] to [1]`. When transitioning scenes, the SceneManager broadcasts: `broadcast (join [Scene] (currentScene))` and coordinates which sprites AND widgets appear or hide. Use `when green flag clicked` → `hide widget [button1 v]` to hide widgets from previous scenes, then `when I receive [Scene2]` → `show widget [button2 v]` to reveal widgets for the new scene. The SceneManager handles all scene transitions, widget visibility, background changes (`switch backdrop to [forest v]`), and story state tracking in one place. This architecture makes complex multi-scene stories easier to debug and expand.

ID: T15.G7.03
Topic: T15 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Split text at delimiter
Description: Parse structured text by finding delimiter characters (like ":") and extracting the parts before and after. Use a loop to find the delimiter position: `set [position v] to (0)`, `repeat (length of [text v])` with `if <(letter (i) of (text)) = [:]> then set [position v] to (i)`. Once found, extract the parts: `set [beforeColon v] to (letter (1) to (position) of (text))` for everything before the delimiter, `set [afterColon v] to (letter ((position) + (2)) to (length of (text)) of (text))` for everything after (skip the colon itself with +2 to also skip the space). Use this to parse dialogue data like "Alice: Hello!" into speaker "Alice" and dialogue "Hello!". This prepares you for advanced dialogue systems with speaker tags.

* T12.G5.01: Use text operations to extract substrings
* T15.G6.02: List-based Dialogue
* T07.G5.01: Use loops with exit conditions

Topic: T15 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Dialogue system with speaker tags
Description: Build a dialogue system where each list item in `[dialogueData v]` contains speaker name and text separated by a colon (e.g., "Alice: Hello there!", "Bob: Hi Alice!"). Loop through the list: `repeat (length of [dialogueData v])` with `set [currentLine v] to (item (i) of [dialogueData v])`. Parse each line using text splitting techniques from T15.G7.03 to extract `[speaker v]` and `[dialogue v]`. Use broadcasts to make the correct sprite speak: `broadcast (join [speak_] (speaker))`, then in each character sprite: `when I receive [speak_Alice]` → `say (dialogue)`. This creates a centralized dialogue system where you write conversations in a list ("Alice: Hi", "Bob: Hey") and the sprites automatically speak their lines. Easy to edit dialogue without changing code.
