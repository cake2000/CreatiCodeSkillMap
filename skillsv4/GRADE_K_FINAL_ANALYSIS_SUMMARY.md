## 3. Dependency Analysis

### Dependency Statistics

- **Total dependencies:** 132
- **Skills with dependencies:** 83 (85.6%)
- **Skills without dependencies:** 14 (14.4%)
- **Average dependencies per skill (when >0):** 1.59
- **Cross-topic dependencies:** 78 (59.1%)
- **Same-topic dependencies:** 54 (40.9%)

### Dependency Rule Compliance

✅ **PERFECT COMPLIANCE**
- **Zero violations** of the X-2 rule
- All Grade K skills depend only on other Grade K skills
- No forward references (depending on Grade 1+ skills)
- No circular dependencies detected

### Cross-Topic Dependency Patterns

The **78 cross-topic dependencies** show strong curriculum integration:

**Most Connected Topics:**

- **T09 (Variables & Expressions)** → feeds into 8 topics
- **T08 (Conditions & Logic)** → feeds into 7 topics
- **T10 (Lists & Tables)** → feeds into 7 topics

**Example Integration Pathways:**

2. T01.GK.01 (Sequencing) → T09.GK.01 (Variables) → T10.GK.02 (Counting) → T27 (Data Analysis)
3. T04.GK.01 (Patterns) → T20 (Art) + T21 (AI) + T26 (Data Logging)

---

## 4. Potential Missing Dependencies (13 Found)

The analysis identified skills that use concepts without explicit dependencies on foundational skills. **These should be reviewed and potentially corrected.**

### Category A: Missing Sequencing Dependencies (4 skills)

Skills that use sequencing concepts but don't depend on T01.GK.01 or similar:

1. **T03.GK.04: Choose the missing middle step in a routine**
   - Uses "first, middle, last" sequencing
   - Should depend on: T01.GK.01

2. **T04.GK.02: Extend a repeating pattern by one tile**
   - Requires understanding sequence continuation
   - Should depend on: T01.GK.01

3. **T08.GK.02: Choose what happens next based on yes/no**
   - Uses "what happens next" sequencing
   - Should depend on: T01.GK.01

4. **T26.GK.02: Use tokens to log repeated events**
   - Logs events in sequence
   - Should depend on: T01.GK.01

### Category B: Missing Pattern Dependencies (2 skills)

Skills that work with patterns but don't depend on T04.GK.01:

5. **T04.GK.03: Describe a pattern using simple words**
   - Describes repeating patterns
   - Already depends on T04.GK.02, but T04.GK.02 should depend on T04.GK.01

6. **T04.GK.04: Fix a broken pattern by replacing one tile**
   - Fixes repeating patterns
   - Already depends on T04.GK.02, but T04.GK.02 should depend on T04.GK.01

### Category C: Missing Counting/Number Dependencies (3 skills)

Skills that use counting/numbers but don't depend on T09.GK.01:

7. **T10.GK.03: Find which group has more**
   - Compares quantities
   - Currently depends on T10.GK.02, which depends on T09.GK.01
   - **May be acceptable as transitive dependency**

8. **T29.GK.01: Recognize text vs pictures**
   - Description mentions counting letters
   - Should depend on: T09.GK.01 (if counting is used)

9. **T32.GK.03: Understand that passwords keep things safe**
   - Compares password length (longer is better)
   - Should depend on: T09.GK.01

### Category D: Missing Sorting/Grouping Dependencies (4 skills)

Skills that use sorting/categorization but don't depend on T10.GK.01:

10. **T10.GK.03: Find which group has more**
    - Already flagged above
    - Assumes groups are sorted

11. **T27.GK.02: Compare which group has more**
    - Compares sorted groups
    - Currently depends on T09.GK.01 and T27.GK.01
    - T27.GK.01 depends on T10.GK.01
    - **May be acceptable as transitive dependency**

12. **T31.GK.01: Recognize devices that connect to internet**
    - Sorts devices into "connects" vs "doesn't connect"
    - Should depend on: T10.GK.01

13. **T32.GK.04: Distinguish online vs offline activities**
    - Sorts activities into categories
    - Currently depends on T08.GK.01 and T32.GK.01
    - Should also depend on: T10.GK.01

### Recommendation

**Review these 13 skills and determine if dependencies should be added.** Some may be acceptable as transitive dependencies (e.g., skill A depends on B, which depends on C, so A doesn't need to directly depend on C). However, for critical foundational concepts, explicit dependencies are recommended.

---

## 5. Isolated Skills (3 Found)

These skills have **no dependencies and no skills depend on them**. They may be standalone concepts or may need better curriculum integration.

1. **T15.GK.02: Match emotions to faces**
   - Standalone emotional literacy skill
   - Could potentially be used in storytelling or animation contexts
   - **Recommendation:** Consider if other skills could benefit from emotion recognition (e.g., AI, chatbots, character design)

2. **T15.GK.03: Identify speech bubbles**
   - Standalone communication literacy skill
   - Could potentially be used in storytelling or chatbot contexts
   - **Recommendation:** Consider adding dependency from chatbot or storytelling skills

3. **T31.GK.01: Recognize devices that connect to the internet**
   - Standalone internet awareness skill
   - Already flagged for missing dependency on T10.GK.01
   - Could be depended upon by cloud/API skills in later grades
   - **Recommendation:** Add as prerequisite for Grade 1-2 internet/cloud skills

### Overall Assessment

**Only 3 isolated skills (3.1%)** is actually very good. Shows strong curriculum integration. The isolated skills are primarily literacy-focused (emotions, communication, device recognition) which may legitimately be standalone foundational concepts.

## 6. Recommendations for Phase 2 Improvements

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Missing Dependencies (High Impact)

1. **Add T01.GK.01 as dependency for:**
   - T03.GK.04 (missing middle step)
   - T04.GK.02 (extend pattern)
   - T08.GK.02 (what happens next)
   - T26.GK.02 (log events)

2. **Add T04.GK.01 as dependency for:**
   - T04.GK.02 (extend pattern) - this will cascade to T04.GK.03 and T04.GK.04

3. **Add T10.GK.01 as dependency for:**
   - T31.GK.01 (internet devices)
   - T32.GK.04 (online/offline) - alongside existing T08.GK.01

### Priority 2: Consider Transitive Dependencies (Medium Impact)

Review if these need explicit dependencies or if transitive is sufficient:
- T10.GK.03 (depends on T10.GK.02, which depends on T09.GK.01)
- T27.GK.02 (depends on T27.GK.01, which depends on T10.GK.01)

### Priority 3: Enhance Isolated Skills (Low Impact)

Consider adding these skills as dependencies elsewhere:
- T15.GK.02 (emotions) → could support T21-T24 (AI), T15.GK.01 (storytelling)
- T15.GK.03 (speech bubbles) → could support T22 (chatbots), T15.GK.01 (storytelling)
- T31.GK.01 (internet devices) → could support Grade 1 T31/T33 skills

### Priority 4: Documentation

1. **Document the 10 hub skills** in teacher materials as "critical checkpoints"
2. **Create intervention plans** for students struggling with hub skills
3. **Add visual dependency maps** showing cross-topic connections
4. **Clarify transitive vs explicit dependencies** in spec documentation
