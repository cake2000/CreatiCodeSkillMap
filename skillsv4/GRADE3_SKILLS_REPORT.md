## Key Findings

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Grade 3 skills cover 35 out of 36 topics, showing broad curriculum coverage at this grade level.

2. **Focus Areas:** The highest concentration of Grade 3 skills is in:
   - Creative/Interactive topics (Stories, Animation, Games)
   - Core programming concepts (Algorithms, Loops, Conditions)
   - Data structures (Lists, Variables)

3. **Progressive Complexity:** Topics naturally scale from:
   - Basic concepts (T02 Algorithm Diagrams - 6 skills)
   - Core programming (T01, T07, T08 - 5-16 skills)
   - Applied projects (T14, T15, T18 - 11-21 skills)

4. **Appropriate Scope:** The absence of Grade 3 skills in T19 (Multiplayer Apps) reflects appropriate grade-level content sequencing.

5. **Balanced Curriculum:** Good distribution across:
   - Technical skills (programming, algorithms, data)
   - Creative skills (animation, art, games)
   - Conceptual skills (design, ethics, impacts)
   - Practical skills (debugging, testing, UI)
