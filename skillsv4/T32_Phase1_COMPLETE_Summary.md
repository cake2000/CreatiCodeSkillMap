## CHANGES SUMMARY

### 1. FIXED MISSING ID
- **T32.GK.01**: Added missing ID to first skill (line 18778)

### 2. RENUMBERED G3 SKILLS (G3.00 → G3.01)
All Grade 3 skills renumbered to start from .01 instead of .00:

| Old ID | New ID | Skill Name |
|--------|--------|------------|
| T32.G3.00 | T32.G3.01 | Identify parts of URLs and email addresses |
| T32.G3.01 | T32.G3.02 | Explain multi-factor authentication (MFA) with analogies |
| T32.G3.02 | T32.G3.03 | Recognize website safety indicators |
| T32.G3.03 | T32.G3.04 | Evaluate and use sharing settings in CreatiCode projects |
| T32.G3.04 | T32.G3.05 | Recognize phishing-like messages |

**Key Fix:** Removed duplicate dependency from G3.03 (old G3.02). Previously depended on both G3.01 and G3.02 (now G3.02 and G3.03). Removed the G3.02 dependency as MFA is not needed for recognizing HTTPS/padlock icons.

### 3. FLATTENED G5 SUB-SKILL NUMBERING
All Grade 5 sub-numbered skills flattened to sequential numbering:

| Old ID | New ID | Skill Name |
|--------|--------|------------|
| T32.G5.01.01 | T32.G5.01 | Analyze digital social engineering tactics |
| T32.G5.01.02 | T32.G5.02 | Recognize physical security risks |
| T32.G5.02 | T32.G5.03 | Compare privacy policies of kid-friendly apps |
| T32.G5.03.01 | T32.G5.04 | Review and identify PII in AI project data |
| T32.G5.03.02 | T32.G5.05 | Practice redacting sensitive data before sharing |
| T32.G5.03.03 | T32.G5.06 | Understand consent for AI data collection |
| T32.G5.04 | T32.G5.07 | Create backup plans for CreatiCode projects |
| T32.G5.05 | T32.G5.08 | Add consent prompts to AI projects |
| T32.G5.06 | T32.G5.09 | Understand why encryption protects data (unplugged activity) |

### 4. ADDED NEW G4 SKILL
**T32.G4.06 - Report suspicious messages**
- **Description:** Student task about what to do when receiving suspicious messages (MCQ scenario-based)
- **Dependencies:** T32.G3.05 (Recognize phishing-like messages)
- **Purpose:** Fills gap between G3 recognition and G5 analysis

### 5. ADDED NEW G5 SKILL
**T32.G5.10 - Evaluate password strength**
- **Description:** Student task comparing different passwords to determine which is strongest
- **Dependencies:** T32.G4.04 (2FA), T32.G3.02 (MFA)
- **Purpose:** Bridges G4 password management concepts to G6 secure login implementation

### 6. FLATTENED G6 SUB-SKILL NUMBERING
All Grade 6 sub-numbered skills flattened to sequential numbering:

| Old ID | New ID | Skill Name |
|--------|--------|------------|
| T32.G6.01.01 | T32.G6.01 | Identify common malware types |

All Grade 7 sub-numbered skills flattened to sequential numbering:

| Old ID | New ID | Skill Name |
|--------|--------|------------|
| T32.G7.04.01 | T32.G7.04 | Analyze facial recognition technology ethics and societal impacts |
| T32.G7.04.02 | T32.G7.05 | Evaluate emotion detection and behavior analysis ethics |

## DEPENDENCY UPDATES

All dependencies have been systematically updated to reflect the new skill IDs:

### Intra-T32 Dependencies Updated:
1. **G3 skills**: All references to G3.00, G3.01, G3.02, G3.03, G3.04 updated to G3.01-G3.05
2. **G4 skills**: All references to old G3 numbers updated
3. **G5 skills**: All sub-numbered references (G5.01.01, G5.01.02, G5.02, G5.03.01, etc.) updated to flat numbering (G5.01-G5.10)
4. **G6 skills**: All sub-numbered references (G6.01.01, etc.) updated to flat numbering (G6.01-G6.08)
5. **G7 skills**: All references to old G5/G6 sub-numbers updated; G7.04.01/02 flattened to G7.04/05
6. **G8 skills**: All references to old G6/G7 numbers updated; G8.03.01/02 flattened to G8.03/04

### Key Dependency Fix:
**T32.G3.03 (old G3.02)** - Removed unnecessary dependency on T32.G3.02 (MFA). Now only depends on T32.G3.01 (URLs) which makes logical sense for recognizing website safety indicators (HTTPS, padlock).

### Cross-Topic Dependencies:
All cross-topic dependencies remain intact (to T01, T03, T04, T06, T07, T08, T09, T10, T12, T16, T21, T22, T23, T24).

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Skills with Implementation Notes (Already Present):
- **T32.G3.04** (was G3.03): Uses CreatiCode platform's sharing interface, not programming blocks
- **T32.G5.07** (was G5.04): Uses CreatiCode's File menu to download project files, not blocks
- **T32.G6.05** (was G6.02): CreatiCode textbox widgets don't have native password masking; students implement character masking using string operations

### Skills with Implementation Notes (New Skills):
- **T32.G4.06**: MCQ scenario-based with 4 options showing appropriate vs inappropriate responses (CSTA: E1-IC-18, E1-NI-04)
- **T32.G5.10**: MCQ with explanation; introduces concepts of length, complexity, and unpredictability (CSTA: E2-IC-20, E2-NI-04)
