   - No changes to GK, G1, G2, or G3 skills
   - Result: PASSED ✓

3. NO DUPLICATE DEPENDENCIES
   - Script checked for existing dependencies before adding
   - No duplicates were added
   - Result: PASSED ✓

4. DEPENDENCY ORDERING
   - Dependencies sorted by: Topic → Grade → Skill number
   - Format: * T##.G#.##: Skill name
   - Result: PASSED ✓

5. FILE INTEGRITY
   - File changes: +1,331 lines, -139 lines (net: +1,192 lines)

ISSUES AND RESOLUTIONS
================================================================================

1. SKIPPED SKILLS
   Skill ID: T27.G4.02
   Reason: Skill not found in allskills.md
   Note: The file has T27.G4.02b and T27.G4.02c instead
   Impact: Minimal - only 1 skill out of 287

2. X-2 VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED (NOT ADDED)
   Skill ID: T01.G4.12
   Invalid dependency: T01.G1.08 (Grade 1)
   Action: Dependency was NOT added (already existed)
   Note: This pre-existing dependency should be reviewed separately

QUALITY ASSURANCE
================================================================================

Sample verification of modified skills:

1. T01.G4.02 - Implement a written plan in code
   ✓ Added 4 dependencies (T06.G2.01, T06.G2.02, T07.G2.01, T13.G3.01)
   ✓ All dependencies properly sorted
   ✓ Skill names correctly formatted

2. T01.G4.10 - Trace a multi-step algorithm with loops and variables
   ✓ Added 7 dependencies
   ✓ Proper ordering: T01.G2.01, T02.G2.01, T02.G2.02, T04.G2.01,
      T04.G2.02, T07.G2.01, T13.G3.01
   ✓ No duplicates with existing dependencies

3. T35.G4.03.01 - (Most dependencies added)
   ✓ Added 8 dependencies
   ✓ Mix of G2 and G3 dependencies (X-2 compliant)
   ✓ Properly sorted and formatted

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Review T01.G4.12's existing dependency on T01.G1.08
   - This violates the X-2 rule but was pre-existing
   - Should be removed in a separate update

2. Investigate T27.G4.02 naming discrepancy
   - Analysis file references T27.G4.02
   - Actual file has T27.G4.02b and T27.G4.02c
   - May need to update analysis or split dependencies

3. Consider periodic validation
   - Run dependency validation regularly
   - Check for new X-2 violations
   - Ensure dependency graph remains acyclic

CONCLUSION
================================================================================
The Grade 4 cross-topic dependencies have been successfully applied to
allskills.md. All verification checks passed, and the changes follow the
required rules:
  ✓ Only additions (no removals)
  ✓ X-2 rule compliance
  ✓ No duplicates
  ✓ Proper ordering
  ✓ Grade 4 skills only

The file is ready for review and commit.
