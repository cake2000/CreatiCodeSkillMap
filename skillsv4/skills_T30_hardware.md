# T30 – Devices & Hardware Systems: K–8 Skill List (Draft v3)

Topic reference: `T30 Devices & Hardware` in `domains_topics_overview.md`
Domain: Systems & Security (D4) · CSTA focus: SAS‑HW, SAS‑CS (links to PRO‑PF, CAS‑ET)

Each skill below has:

- a stable **ID** (`T30.G<grade>.<nn>`),
- an IXL-style **short name**,
- a **description** (what understanding/behavior it targets),
- a **challenge format** (the typical problem type to assess it).

Where relevant, a primary **CSTA code** is noted.

**Role and scope in v3:** Students encounter hardware every time they build with CreatiCode—microphones for voice AI, cameras for pose detection, GPUs for rendering, controllers for games. T30 scaffolds this awareness from picture-based recognition (K–2) to concrete component roles (3–5) and system-level tradeoffs (6–8). Younger grades stay conceptual and descriptive; advanced grades analyze specs, plan deployments, and address AI4K12 priorities around sensors, privacy, and societal impact. Topics T23–T24 (AI perception/XO) and T28 (simulations) depend on students understanding the hardware constraints described here.
