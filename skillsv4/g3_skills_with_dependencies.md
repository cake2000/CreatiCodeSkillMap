Description: Students add one item to the end of a short list or remove one obvious item, focusing on understanding that lists can grow and shrink. Keep operations very simple (add one specific item, remove one specific item) and show the visual change in the list display.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand when to use custom blocks vs loops
Description: Students differentiate between using a loop (for repeating the exact same action a fixed number of times) and a custom block (for grouping a complex or varied sequence and reusing it). Both organize code, but for different purposes. This conceptual gateway skill builds organizational thinking without requiring students to define functions yet.
