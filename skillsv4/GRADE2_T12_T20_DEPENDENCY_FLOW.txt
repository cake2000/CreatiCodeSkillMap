DEPENDENCY STRENGTH BY TARGET TOPIC
------------------------------------

T12 (Documentation)          : 1 addition  (sequencing)
T13 (Debugging)              : 1 addition  (conditionals)
T14 (Games)                  : 2 additions (data + conditionals)
T15 (Animation)              : 3 additions (patterns + loops) ⚠ HIGH
T16 (UI)                     : 2 additions (conditionals + decomp)
T17 (Motion)                 : 0 additions (good coverage)
T18 (3D)                     : 1 addition  (2D foundation)
T20 (Generative Art)         : 3 additions (patterns) ⚠ HIGH


FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS USAGE COUNT
------------------------------------

T04 (Pattern Recognition)    : ████████ 6 uses (46%)
T08 (Conditional Logic)      : ████ 3 uses (23%)
T01 (Sequencing)             : █ 1 use (8%)
T02 (Data/Algorithms)        : █ 1 use (8%)
T03 (Decomposition)          : █ 1 use (8%)
T07 (Loops)                  : █ 1 use (8%)
T17 (2D Motion)              : █ 1 use (8%)


KEY DEPENDENCY CHAINS
------------------------------------

Pattern Recognition Chain:
  T04.G1.01 ──→ T15.G2.01 ──→ [Animation speed understanding]
  T04.G1.01 ──→ T20.G2.01 ──→ [Art repetition]
  T04.G1.02 ──→ T20.G2.02 ──→ [Art symmetry]
  T04.G2.01 ──→ T15.G2.03 ──→ [Animation loops]
  T04.G2.02 ──→ T20.G2.03 ──→ [Art layering]

Conditional Logic Chain:
  T08.G1.01 ──→ T13.G2.04 ──→ [Debugging checks]
            ──→ T14.G2.03 ──→ [Game progression]
            ──→ T16.G2.01 ──→ [UI interactions]

Spatial Reasoning Chain:
  T17.G1.01 ──→ T18.G2.01 ──→ [2D to 3D progression]


MOST CRITICAL ADDITION
------------------------------------

⚠ T15.G2.03: "Loop patterns in animation"
   BEFORE: Only had T01.G1.07 (algorithm comparison)
   AFTER:  + T04.G2.01 (pattern recognition)
           + T07.G1.01 (loop understanding)
   
   WHY CRITICAL: Skill name explicitly mentions "loop patterns"
   but had NO dependencies on pattern (T04) or loop (T07) topics!


GRADE LEVEL DISTRIBUTION
------------------------------------

Prerequisites from Grade K (GK):  0 (0%)
Prerequisites from Grade 1 (G1):  9 (69%)
Prerequisites from Grade 2 (G2):  2 (15%)  [T04.G2.01, T04.G2.02]

This shows good scaffolding: G2 skills primarily build on G1 foundations,
with some G2-to-G2 dependencies for advanced pattern work.


X-2 RULE COMPLIANCE
------------------------------------

✓ All Grade 2 skills only depend on:
  - Kindergarten (GK) skills: 0 used
  - Grade 1 (G1) skills: 9 used
  - Grade 2 (G2) skills: 2 used
  
✓ 100% compliant with X-2 rule
✓ No dependencies on Grade 3+ skills
✓ All prerequisite skills verified to exist
