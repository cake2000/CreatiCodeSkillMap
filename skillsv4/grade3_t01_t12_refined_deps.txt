# GRADE 3 CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCY RECOMMENDATIONS (T01-T12) - REFINED
# Missing dependencies that should be ADDED
# Manually verified based on skill descriptions

T01.G3.12: Predict the final state of a simple algorithm
ADD DEPENDENCY: T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple loop
REASON: Skill traces scripts that may include loops

T01.G3.16: Identify when to use 'repeat forever' vs 'repeat N times'
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Skill discusses checking conditions (key pressed) within loops

T02.G3.03: Build a block sequence for a simple task
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Skill works with if/else decisions

T02.G3.04: Trace a block sequence with an if/else decision
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Skill works with if/else decisions

T02.G3.05: Create a block script with one if/else decision
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Skill works with if/else decisions

T02.G3.06: Compare two block sequences for the same task
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Skill works with if/else decisions

T04.G3.04.02: Create a custom block (template) for repeated code patterns
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Custom blocks with parameters build on variable concepts

T04.G3.08: Match algorithm descriptions to code pattern shapes
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Skill involves recognizing code patterns with variables

T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
ADD DEPENDENCY: T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
REASON: Conditionals need event context to execute

T08.G3.05: Fix a condition that uses the wrong comparison operator
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Comparison operators typically compare variables

T09.G3.01.02: Set a variable to an initial value at program start
ADD DEPENDENCY: T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
REASON: Setting initial values happens on program start (event)

T09.G3.01.03: Change a variable value by 1 using the change block
ADD DEPENDENCY: T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
REASON: Variable changes occur in event-triggered scripts

T10.G3.07: Count items in a list that match a condition
ADD DEPENDENCY: T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
REASON: Counting items requires iterating through the list

T12.G3.03.01: Use clearer variable names to improve readability
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Naming variables requires understanding of variables

T12.G3.03.03: Split complex scripts into separate event-driven scripts
ADD DEPENDENCY: T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
REASON: Splitting into event-driven scripts requires event understanding
