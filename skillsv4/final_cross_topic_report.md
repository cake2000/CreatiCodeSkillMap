---

### 2. T01.GK.03 - Find the first and last pictures

**Current Dependencies:** T01.GK.02, T05.GK.01

**Add Dependency:** T01.GK.01

**Reason:** Identifying first/last positions requires understanding of sequence order

---

### 3. T20.GK.04 - Fix the mixed-up art plan (picture-only)

**Current Dependencies:** T04.GK.01

**Add Dependency:** T01.GK.01

**Reason:** Fixing mixed-up plan requires understanding correct order

---

### 4. T24.GK.03 - Give simple instructions to an AI helper

**Current Dependencies:** T24.GK.02

**Add Dependency:** T01.GK.01

**Reason:** Giving clear step-by-step instructions requires sequencing

---

## Pattern Recognition

### 1. T20.GK.02 - Order art steps with cards

**Current Dependencies:** T01.GK.01

**Add Dependency:** T04.GK.01

**Reason:** Describing patterns requires recognizing them

---

## Sorting/Categorization

### 1. T10.GK.05 - Find the first and last item in a row

**Current Dependencies:** T01.GK.01, T01.GK.03

**Add Dependency:** T10.GK.01

**Reason:** Deciding which group item belongs to requires categorization

---

### 2. T22.GK.02 - Practice asking a picture helper a friendly question

**Current Dependencies:** T22.GK.01

**Add Dependency:** T10.GK.01

**Reason:** Organizing data by categories requires categorization

---

## Conditional Thinking

### 1. T25.GK.02 - Match quantities to symbols

**Current Dependencies:** T25.GK.01, T09.GK.01

**Add Dependency:** T08.GK.01

**Reason:** Understanding AI making choices based on conditions uses if-then logic

---

### 2. T25.GK.03 - Build a two-symbol legend

**Current Dependencies:** T25.GK.02

**Add Dependency:** T08.GK.01

**Reason:** Building decision rules (legend) uses conditional thinking

---

## Variables/Numbers

### 1. T22.GK.01 - Recognize a talking helper vs a silent toy

**Current Dependencies:** None

**Add Dependency:** T09.GK.01

**Reason:** Recognizing counting/tracking involves variable/number concepts
