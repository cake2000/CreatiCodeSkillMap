# GRADE 3 CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS (T01-T12)
# FINAL CURATED RECOMMENDATIONS
# Manually verified against actual skill descriptions
# Only includes genuinely MISSING dependencies that should be ADDED

## HIGH CONFIDENCE RECOMMENDATIONS (5)

T04.G3.04.02: Create a custom block (template) for repeated code patterns
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Description explicitly states "using parameters or variables as placeholders" - custom blocks with parameters build on variable concepts

T04.G3.08: Match algorithm descriptions to code pattern shapes
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Description includes "count how many times" pattern which requires counter variables

T12.G3.03.01: Use clearer variable names to improve readability
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Skill is explicitly about naming variables - requires understanding of variables

T12.G3.03.04: Combine similar consecutive blocks
ADD DEPENDENCY: T09.G3.01.01: Create a variable and set it
REASON: Examples include "change score by 1" blocks - works with variables

T02.G3.04: Trace a block sequence with an if/else decision
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Skill explicitly traces scripts with if/else blocks

## MEDIUM CONFIDENCE RECOMMENDATIONS (2)

T02.G3.05: Create a block script with one if/else decision
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Skill explicitly creates scripts with if/else blocks (may have transitive dep through T02.G3.04)

T01.G3.16: Identify when to use 'repeat forever' vs 'repeat N times'
ADD DEPENDENCY: T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
REASON: Example mentions "checking if a key is pressed" which involves conditionals - though this is a peripheral mention

## NOT RECOMMENDED (rejected after manual review)

T12.G3.01: Add a comment to explain a block in a script
REJECT REASON: "score" only mentioned as example in comments, not core to skill

T12.G3.05: Create and use a simple custom block without parameters
REJECT REASON: Explicitly states "WITHOUT parameters" - mentions parameter only to clarify it doesn't use them

T08.G3.05: Fix a condition that uses the wrong comparison operator
REJECT REASON: Has transitive dependency on T09 through T08.G3.01a → T09.G3.01.04 (though parser may miss this due to formatting)

T01.G3.12: Predict the final state of a simple algorithm
REJECT REASON: "possibly with a loop" is too weak to require loop dependency - existing T06.G3.01 dep is sufficient

## SUMMARY

Total HIGH CONFIDENCE recommendations: 5
Total MEDIUM CONFIDENCE recommendations: 2
Total recommendations: 7

These dependencies follow the X-2 rule (Grade 3 can only depend on Grade K, 1, 2, or 3 skills).
