================================================================================
SECTION 2: SPECIFIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

A. DEPENDENCY VIOLATIONS (X-2 RULE)
------------------------------------
⚠️ T03.G4.06 - Update a plan after testing feedback
   - Depends on T06.G2.01, T06.G2.02 (Grade 2 deps when in Grade 4)
   - VIOLATION: References skills 2 grades below (should be max 2 grades back)
   - Impact: Creates backward dependency on much earlier content

⚠️ T03.G6.04 - Adjust milestones when constraints are discovered
   - Depends on T03.G4.06 (Grade 4 skill when in Grade 6)
   - This creates a chain that pulls in the G2 violations

B. EXCESSIVE DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------
⚠️ T03.G4.01 - Break a medium-size project into components
   - Has 7 dependencies (6 cross-topic + 1 intra-topic)
   - Too many prerequisites for a single skill
   - Suggests the skill might be too complex

⚠️ T03.G4.06 - Update a plan after testing feedback
   - Has 8 dependencies
   - Excessive coupling indicates skill is too broad
   - Should be broken down into smaller skills

C. SKILLS THAT ARE TOO BROAD
-----------------------------
⚠️ T03.G4.01 - Break a medium-size project into components
   ISSUE: This is a complex skill covering multiple concepts
   - Identifying components
   - Understanding component responsibilities
   - Differentiating component types
   RECOMMENDATION: Break into sub-skills:
   - T03.G4.01.01: Identify candidate components in a project
   - T03.G4.01.02: Define clear responsibilities for each component
   - T03.G4.01.03: Distinguish data components from logic components

⚠️ T03.G7.01 - Draw an architecture diagram for a multi-component project
   ISSUE: "Multi-component project" is very broad
   - Choosing diagram notation
   - Identifying what to include/exclude
   - Showing relationships
   RECOMMENDATION: Break into steps:
   - T03.G7.01.01: Choose appropriate diagram elements for project complexity
   - T03.G7.01.02: Map components and connections in an architecture diagram
   - T03.G7.01.03: Annotate diagrams with data flows and interactions

⚠️ T03.G8.01 - Outline a formal project specification
   ISSUE: "Formal specification" covers many aspects
   - Overview section
   - Features section
   - Data section
   - UI section
   - Testing section
   RECOMMENDATION: Consider breaking down by section or add scaffolding

⚠️ T03.G8.05 - Propose a refactoring plan for a complex project
   ISSUE: Very advanced and open-ended
   - Analyzing existing structure
   - Identifying problems
   - Proposing solutions
   - Creating implementation plan
   RECOMMENDATION: Already somewhat scoped but could benefit from scaffolding

D. VAGUE OR UNCLEAR DESCRIPTIONS
---------------------------------
⚠️ T03.G5.03 - Identify task dependencies in a project plan
   ISSUE: Dependencies list shows "T03.G4.01" without description
   - Incomplete dependency reference
   - Makes it hard to understand prerequisites

⚠️ T03.G7.01 - Dependencies include: "T10.G5.01: Architecture diagrams represent components as structured collections."
   ISSUE: This reads like a description, not a skill title
   - Inconsistent dependency format
   - Needs cleanup

⚠️ T03.G7.02 - Dependency: "T11.G5.01: Mapping functional modules requires understanding modular decomposition and func"
   ISSUE: Description is truncated ("func")
   - Incomplete text

E. PROGRESSION ISSUES
----------------------
⚠️ Gap between G2 and G3 transition
   - G2 ends with "Identify what a simple game or story can do"
   - G3 starts with "Identify features in a small game description"
   - These are very similar - potential overlap/redundancy

⚠️ Sudden complexity jump at G4
   - G4.01 has 7 dependencies suddenly
   - May need intermediate scaffolding skills in late G3

⚠️ Module concept introduced late
   - "Modules" first appear in G4.02
   - Concept of grouping components into higher-level structures
   - Could benefit from earlier, simpler introduction

F. AGE-APPROPRIATENESS CONCERNS
--------------------------------
✓ GK-G2: Appropriate (picture-based, unplugged, concrete routines)
✓ G3: Appropriate (beginning block-based project planning)
✓ G4-G5: Appropriate (team projects, structured planning)
⚠️ G6-G8: Some skills may be ambitious but not inappropriate
   - T03.G8.05 "Propose refactoring plan" is very advanced
   - T03.G8.01 "Formal specification" is professional-level
   - These push boundaries but may be acceptable for advanced 8th graders

G. DUPLICATES AND OVERLAPS
---------------------------
⚠️ Potential overlap:
   T03.G2.05 - "Identify what a simple game or story can do"
   T03.G3.01 - "Identify features in a small game description"
   ISSUE: These seem to cover very similar ground
   RECOMMENDATION: Either merge or differentiate more clearly

⚠️ Potential overlap:
   T03.G5.06 - "Identify modules in example projects"
   T03.G6.01 - "Propose modules for a medium project"
   ISSUE: Both about identifying/proposing modules
   RECOMMENDATION: G5.06 should be receptive (analyzing existing), G6.01 productive (creating new) - distinction is present but could be clearer

H. MISSING SCAFFOLDING
-----------------------
⚠️ Missing: Introduction to components vs features
   - Features introduced in G2
   - Components introduced in G4
   - No explicit skill bridging these concepts in G3

⚠️ Missing: Simple module concept in G3
   - Modules suddenly appear in G4.02
   - Could use a G3 skill like "Group related parts into simple modules"

⚠️ Missing: Dependency understanding before G5
   - G5.03 is first skill explicitly about dependencies
   - Earlier grades work with sequences but not dependencies
   - Could add G4 skill: "Identify which tasks must come before others"

⚠️ Missing: Architecture basics before G7
   - G7.01 jumps to "architecture diagram"
   - No prior introduction to architecture concepts
   - Could add G6 skill: "Describe the high-level structure of a project"

I. CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCY CONCERNS
-----------------------------------
Many skills have extensive cross-topic dependencies, which is expected, but some notable patterns:

⚠️ Heavy dependency on T06, T07, T08, T09 (Events, Loops, Conditionals, Variables)
   - This is logical but creates tight coupling
   - Students must complete significant portions of multiple topics before progressing in T03

⚠️ T03.G8.06 depends on T32.G6.01 (Identify common malware types)
   ISSUE: This seems unrelated - why does decomposition depend on cybersecurity?
   RECOMMENDATION: Review if this dependency is necessary

================================================================================

SECTION 6: SUMMARY STATISTICS
================================================================================

Total T03 Skills: 54
- Kindergarten: 5
- Grade 1: 4
- Grade 2: 5 (includes 1 sub-skill .01)
- Grade 3: 7 (includes 2 sub-skills .01)
- Grade 4: 6
- Grade 5: 6
- Grade 6: 5
- Grade 7: 6
- Grade 8: 6

Proposed New Skills: 16
- Grade 2: 1 (T03.G2.06)
- Grade 3: 1 (T03.G3.08)
- Grade 4: 4 (T03.G4.01.01-04, T03.G4.06.01-02)
- Grade 6: 1 (T03.G6.06)
- Grade 7: 3 (T03.G7.01.01-03)
- Grade 8: 4 (T03.G8.01.01-04)

Critical Issues Found: 4
- X-2 rule violations: 1 (T03.G4.06)
- Excessive dependencies (>6): 2 (T03.G4.01, T03.G4.06)
- Questionable cross-topic dependency: 1 (T03.G8.06→T32.G6.01)

Skills Needing Breakdown: 5
- T03.G4.01 (7 deps, too complex)
- T03.G4.06 (8 deps, too broad)
- T03.G7.01 (architecture diagram - complex)
- T03.G8.01 (formal spec - very broad)
- T03.G8.05 (refactoring plan - complex but acceptable)

Clarity Issues: 3
- Incomplete dependency references (T03.G5.03)
- Truncated descriptions (T03.G7.02)
- Inconsistent dependency format (T03.G7.01)

Progression Quality:
- K→G1: Excellent
- G1→G2: Excellent  
- G2→G3: Good (minor overlap issue)
- G3→G4: Needs improvement (steep jump)
- G4→G5: Good
- G5→G6: Excellent
- G6→G7: Excellent
- G7→G8: Excellent

Overall Assessment: STRONG FOUNDATION with SPECIFIC ISSUES TO ADDRESS
- The progression from concrete part identification to abstract architecture is coherent
- Age-appropriate development through grades K-8
- Main concerns are G4 complexity spike and some dependency violations
- Recommended additions will smooth progression and reduce coupling
