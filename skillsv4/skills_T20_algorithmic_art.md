# T20 – Algorithmic Art & Creative Coding: K–8 Skill List (Draft v2)

Topic reference: `T20 Creative Coding` in `domains_topics_overview.md`
Domain: Programming (D2) & Data/Analysis (D3) · CSTA focus: PRO‑PF, DAA‑DI, CAS‑ET

Each skill below has:

- a stable **ID** (`T20.G<grade>.<nn>`),
- an IXL‑style **short name**,
- a **description** (what understanding/behavior it targets),
- a **challenge format** (the typical problem type to assess it).

Grades K‑2 stay unplugged/picture‑based (no blocks yet). Coding begins in Grade 3 and ramps up through Grade 8. All skills should feel playful and art‑driven, with clear scaffolds between grades and to adjacent topics (loops, data, media, AI).
