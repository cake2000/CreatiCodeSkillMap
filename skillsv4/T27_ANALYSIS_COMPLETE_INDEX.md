## 🏆 KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

### STRENGTHS
✅ Excellent K-2 unplugged foundation with concrete activities
✅ Strong integration with CreatiCode's data infrastructure
✅ Clear progression: visual → computational → interactive
✅ Good ethical considerations (fairness metrics in G7)

### WEAKNESSES
⚠ 5 skills bundle too many concepts (need splitting)
⚠ 4 critical scaffolding gaps (especially widget foundation)
⚠ 2 dependency violations (backward deps, misordering)
⚠ 9 CreatiCode block categories requiring verification
⚠ Some Grade 4 content too advanced for math level

### OPPORTUNITIES
💡 Add explicit chart type selection skill
💡 Strengthen connection to T25 (AI Ethics) for fairness
💡 Create widget curriculum spanning G4-G7
💡 Build data quality literacy progression K-8

### THREATS/RISKS
🔴 Some advanced blocks (pivot, Google Sheets) may not exist
🔴 Widget blocks need verification before G5+ skills can be finalized
🔴 Renumbering skills could break external references

### Cross-Topic Dependencies
T27 depends heavily on:
- **T10 (Lists & Tables):** Table operations, list operations

- **T09 (Variables):** Display values, trace code, model quantities
- **T06 (Events):** Green-flag scripts, broadcasts for dashboards
- **T08 (Conditionals):** For filtering, data quality checks

T27 may be prerequisite for:
- **T25 (AI Ethics):** Fairness evaluation uses T27 analysis skills
- **Science/Math integration:** Data-driven projects

## 💬 COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Why are there so many new skills to add?
**A:** T27 had scaffolding gaps, especially in G3-G5 where concepts jumped too quickly. Adding 7 skills (spread across 4 grades) fills these gaps and creates smoother progression.

### Q: Can I skip the block verification?
**A:** NO. Block verification is CRITICAL. Many skills reference specific CreatiCode blocks. If blocks don't exist, skills need major rewrites or may be impossible to implement.

### Q: Which issues should I fix first?
**A:** Follow this order:
1. Verify blocks (foundation for everything else)
2. Fix dependency violations (affects numbering)
3. Split over-broad skills (core fixes)
4. Add new skills (fills gaps)
5. Polish descriptions (final refinement)

### Q: How does this compare to other topics?
**A:** T27 is similar to other topics in needing block verification and scaffolding improvements. It's better than average in having a strong K-2 foundation. The widget gap is unique to interactive data topics.

### Q: What if CreatiCode doesn't have pivot tables or Google Sheets blocks?
**A:** Three options:
1. Implement algorithmic versions (loops + conditionals)
2. Mark skills as "advanced/optional"
3. Move skills to later grade when implementation is simpler
The analysis provides fallback plans for each questionable block.

### Q: Will these changes break other topics?
**A:** Unlikely. Analysis preserves all cross-topic dependencies (T01, T06-T10, T24-T26). Only intra-T27 dependencies are modified. However, search for T27.G4.04b before renumbering it.

## 📝 NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

### Pattern: Middle Grade Complexity
Like other topics analyzed, T27 shows K-2 excellence, G6-8 strength, but G3-5 needs optimization. This appears to be a common pattern worth investigating across all topics.

### Pattern: Platform Block Verification
Multiple topics require CreatiCode block verification. Consider creating a comprehensive CreatiCode Block Reference spanning all topics.

### Unique Feature: External Integrations
T27's Google Sheets integration is unique. If successful, this pattern could be replicated in other topics (T26 data collection from Google Forms, etc.).

### Ethical Integration
T27.G7.03 (fairness metrics) is a good example of integrating AI ethics into a non-ethics topic. This cross-topic integration model could be expanded.
