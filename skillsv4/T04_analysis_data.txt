SUMMARY OF ISSUES
=================

CRITICAL PRIORITY - BROKEN REFERENCES:
1. T04.G7.02 depends on "T04.G5.01: Identify the repeating unit" - WRONG! T04.G5.01 is "Recognize a counter update pattern"
   Should depend on T04.G2.01 instead

2. T04.G7.05 depends on "T04.G5.01: Identify the repeating unit" - WRONG! Same issue as above
   Should depend on T04.G2.01 instead

HIGH PRIORITY - X-2 RULE VIOLATIONS:
All G4+ skills depend on T04.GK.03 and/or T04.GK.04 (kindergarten skills)
- This violates the X-2 rule (skills should only depend on X, X-1, or X-2 grades)
- G4 → GK = 4 grades back (should be max 2)
- These dependencies should be replaced with more recent grade equivalents or removed

MEDIUM PRIORITY - MISSING DEPENDENCIES:
T04.G7.06 has NO dependencies, but clearly needs prerequisites

ANALYSIS OF DEPENDENCY PATTERN:
- T04.GK.03 "Describe a pattern using simple words" is used as a dep in 19+ later skills (G4-G8)
- T04.GK.04 "Fix a broken pattern by replacing one tile" is used as a dep in 24+ later skills (G4-G8)
- These are being used as "foundational" skills but violate X-2 rule
- Need to either:
  a) Remove these deps (assume K-2 foundational knowledge)
  b) Create "refresher" skills in G3 that can serve as valid dependencies for G4+

RECOMMENDATION: Remove T04.GK.03 and T04.GK.04 from all G4+ dependencies
- These are foundational K-2 skills that should be assumed knowledge
- Students who reach G4 have already mastered these concepts 2+ years ago
