ID: T07.G4.03
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use a loop counter variable and for loops
Description: Students create and use a counter variable that increments on each loop iteration (e.g., to show "Step 1, Step 2, …" or to track how many loops have run). They also learn to use CreatiCode's `for [variable] from (START) to (LIMIT) at step (S)` block, which provides a built-in loop variable that automatically increments. Students practice with different start values, limits, and step sizes (e.g., counting by 2s for even numbers, or using step -1 to count down). Note: This skill covers both manual counter variables (set counter to 0, change counter by 1) AND the for-loop block. For beginners, start with manual counters to understand the concept, then introduce the for-loop block as a cleaner alternative.

ID: T07.G4.08
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use timed repeat for spaced animations
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `repeat (N) times at intervals of (T)` block to create animations where actions happen with visible pauses between them (e.g., a countdown timer showing 3...2...1, a character blinking every 0.5 seconds, or a sprite moving in discrete steps).

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace nested loops with variable bounds
Description: Students analyze code with nested loops where the loop bounds depend on variables or expressions (e.g., `repeat (rows)` or `repeat (n-1)`), predicting how many times the inner loop executes for different outer loop values. The key challenge is understanding that when the bound changes each iteration (e.g., `repeat (n - i)` where i is the outer counter), the total iterations require calculation. Unlike G4.07's constant bounds, students must reason about changing iteration counts.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace nested loops using a trace table
Description: Students learn the trace table technique as a systematic method for tracking variable changes through nested loops. They create a table with columns for each variable and rows for each iteration, filling in values step-by-step. This methodical approach helps debug complex loop logic and is particularly useful for competition problems where mental tracing is error-prone. Unlike T07.G6.06 which applies trace tables to visual pattern problems, this skill focuses on learning the trace table methodology itself. Students practice the systematic technique of creating a table with columns for each variable and rows for iterations, which is essential for debugging complex loops and succeeding in programming competitions.

ID: T07.G6.08
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use break and continue to control loop flow
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `break` block to exit a loop early when a condition is met (e.g., stopping a search once an item is found), and use the `continue` block to skip the rest of the current iteration without stopping the loop entirely (e.g., skipping invalid items in a list). These loop control statements make code more efficient and clearer than using complex nested conditionals.

Topic: T09 – Variables & Expressions
Skill: Use change and reduce blocks to modify a variable
Description: Students use `change [variable] by (amount)` to increase a variable and `reduce [variable] by (amount)` to decrease it. They understand the difference between "set" (replaces value) and "change/reduce" (adds to or subtracts from current value). Examples: change score by 10, reduce lives by 1. This builds on the basic change-by-1 pattern by using different amounts and directions.

ID: T11.G3.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand when to use custom blocks vs loops
Description: Students identify scenarios where a custom block (called "My Block" in CreatiCode) is more appropriate than a loop. They recognize that loops repeat the SAME action multiple times, while custom blocks group a SEQUENCE of different actions for reuse or organization. Given example scripts or problems, they choose the better organizational approach and explain their reasoning. This conceptual gateway skill builds organizational thinking without requiring students to define custom blocks yet.

Assessment example: Present 3-4 scenarios (e.g., "draw a house," "move 10 steps 5 times," "reset game state," "count to 10"). Students label each as better solved with a loop or a custom block and explain why.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple loop
* T01.G3.12: Predict the final state of a simple algorithm


ID: T11.G3.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Use a pre-made custom block with parameters
Description: Students use an existing custom block (e.g., "DrawRectangle [width] [height]" or "MoveSprite [x] [y]") provided in a starter project, and experiment with different parameter values to see how the block's behavior changes. They learn that parameters let one block handle many situations.

ID: T11.G3.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Identify repeated or grouped actions that could become custom blocks
Description: Students examine a longer script (15-30 blocks) and identify groups of blocks that appear multiple times OR represent distinct behaviors. They draw boxes around these groups and label each with a descriptive name (e.g., "reset player," "check win condition"). This builds the habit of recognizing natural custom block boundaries before actually creating them.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.02: Use a pre-made custom block with parameters
* T09.G3.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
* T08.G3.03: Pick the right conditional block for a scenario


ID: T11.G3.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand the concept of return values
Description: Students learn that some blocks **report** (return) a value instead of just doing an action. In CreatiCode, reporter blocks have rounded shapes and fit inside input slots. Examples include built-in reporters like "random 1 to 10" or "distance to [sprite]". Students identify which blocks return values vs. which blocks perform actions.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.03: Identify repeated or grouped actions that could become custom blocks
* T09.G3.04: Debug a single missing or wrong variable block
* T07.G3.04: Use repeat‑until to reach a simple goal

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Explore the "Make a Block" interface in CreatiCode
Description: Students open CreatiCode's "My Blocks" category, click "Make a Block," and explore the interface options: typing a block name, adding text labels, adding number/text input parameters using parentheses notation like `(width)`. They preview how block definitions work without completing a full custom block yet. This hands-on exploration prepares them for creating their own blocks in Grade 4.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.04: Understand the concept of return values


ID: T11.G4.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Define and call a simple custom block (no parameters)
Description: Students create a custom block with no inputs (e.g., `define (ResetPlayer)`) using CreatiCode's "Make a Block" button. They define the block with 3–5 blocks inside, then use `call ResetPlayer` from a main script. They compare the before/after organization to see how custom blocks improve readability.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T11.G3.05: Explore the "Make a Block" interface in CreatiCode


ID: T11.G4.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Distinguish command blocks from reporter blocks
Description: Students learn to recognize which blocks **do something** (command/stack blocks that perform actions) and which blocks **return a value** (reporter blocks with rounded shapes). In CreatiCode, command blocks stack vertically in scripts, while reporter blocks fit inside input slots. Students categorize a set of blocks and predict where each type can be used.

Assessment example: Given 10 blocks (mix of built-in and custom), students categorize them as "command blocks" (do something) or "reporter blocks" (return a value), and for each one explain where it could be used (in a script stack vs. in an input slot).

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.04: Understand the concept of return values
* T09.G3.01.04: Display variable value on stage using the variable monitor


ID: T11.G4.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Use a reporter block's result in a calculation or condition
Description: Students call built-in reporter blocks (like "random 1 to 10", "distance to sprite", "length of list") and use their returned values directly in conditions or arithmetic expressions (e.g., `if <distance to [sprite] < 50>`, `set x to (random 1 to 10) + 5`). They practice chaining multiple reporters together in compound expressions, understanding that reporters can be nested inside other blocks.

Dependencies:
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script

* T11.G3.04: Understand the concept of return values


ID: T11.G4.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Describe the purpose of each custom block in a script
Description: Students read a script that uses several custom blocks and write a one-sentence description of each block's PURPOSE (e.g., "This block resets the player to the starting position and clears the score"). They focus on WHAT each block does (its goal), not HOW it does it (implementation details). They also identify how blocks fit together in the program's overall structure (e.g., setup, game loop, scoring, ending).

Dependencies:


ID: T11.G4.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Trace execution through a script with custom blocks
Description: Students trace step-by-step through a script that calls custom blocks, predicting the order of execution and the values returned by reporter blocks at each step. They show the flow of control and data through the program, reinforcing their mental model of procedure calls, returns, and the call stack. This is LOW-LEVEL tracing (execution order) as opposed to G4.04's HIGH-LEVEL understanding (purpose).

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.04: Understand the concept of return values


ID: T11.G4.06
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand the argument block for accessing parameters
Description: Students learn that inside a custom block definition, the `argument (name)` reporter block retrieves the value passed in when the block is called. They trace through examples showing how `argument (size)` in a definition like `define (DrawSquare (size))` receives the value `50` when called with `call DrawSquare [50]`. This conceptual understanding prepares them for creating parameterized blocks in Grade 5.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.02: Use a pre-made custom block with parameters


ID: T11.G5.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Decompose a problem into logical custom block boundaries
Description: Given a larger problem description (e.g., "make a quiz game"), students break it down into distinct responsibilities that would each make a good custom block (e.g., "show question," "check answer," "update score," "show results"). This is problem decomposition BEFORE coding - students plan the structure first, then implement. This focuses on design thinking rather than identifying blocks in existing code, teaching students to think about organization from the start of a project.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.04: Describe the purpose of each custom block in a script
* T11.G4.05: Trace execution through a script with custom blocks


ID: T11.G5.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Define a custom block with one parameter
Description: Students create a custom block that takes one input parameter using `define (DrawSquare (size))` syntax. Inside the definition, they access the parameter using the `argument (size)` reporter block, replacing hard-coded values. They call the block with different arguments like `call DrawSquare [50]` to demonstrate reuse.

Assessment example: Students create a custom block `DrawPolygon (sides)` that draws a polygon with the specified number of sides. They test it by calling `call DrawPolygon [3]` (triangle), `call DrawPolygon [4]` (square), and `call DrawPolygon [8]` (octagon).

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.05: Trace execution through a script with custom blocks
* T11.G4.06: Understand the argument block for accessing parameters


ID: T11.G5.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Choose between adding a parameter vs. creating a separate block
Description: Students analyze scenarios and decide whether to add a parameter to an existing custom block OR create a separate block. For example: should "DrawRectangle" have a color parameter, or should there be separate "DrawRedRectangle" and "DrawBlueRectangle" blocks? They justify their design choice based on reusability and clarity.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.01: Decompose a problem into logical custom block boundaries


ID: T11.G5.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Analyze a modular program structure
Description: Students examine a larger project (game, animation, simulation) and identify how it uses custom blocks to organize functionality. They explain how this modular design makes the code easier to understand, modify, and debug compared to a non-modular version.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.04: Describe the purpose of each custom block in a script
* T11.G4.05: Trace execution through a script with custom blocks


ID: T11.G5.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Define a custom block with two or more parameters
Description: Students create a custom block with multiple parameters using `define (DrawRectangle (width) (height))` syntax. Inside the definition, they access each parameter using the `argument` block (e.g., `argument (width)`, `argument (height)`). They practice ordering parameters logically and using clear parameter names, calling the block with various argument combinations like `call DrawRectangle [100] [50]`.

Dependencies:


ID: T11.G5.06
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Define a custom reporter block that returns a value
Description: Students create a custom block that returns a value using CreatiCode's `return [value]` block inside the definition. For example, `define (Average (a) (b))` with a `return` block that computes the average. To use the return value, they call the block with `report Average [10] [20]` instead of `call`, allowing the result to be used in expressions or conditions.

Assessment example: Students create a custom reporter block `Maximum (a) (b)` that returns the larger of two numbers. They test it in different contexts: `say (report Maximum [5] [3])`, `set score to (report Maximum [score] [0])`, and `if <(report Maximum [x] [y]) > 100>`.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.03: Use a reporter block's result in a calculation or condition


ID: T11.G5.07
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Debug a script with incorrect custom block calls

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.05: Trace execution through a script with custom blocks


ID: T11.G5.08
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Use comments to document custom block purpose
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `// [comment]` block to add comments inside and above custom block definitions, documenting what the block does, what each parameter represents, and what value it returns (if any). This practice makes code more readable for others and for their future selves.

Dependencies:


ID: T11.G6.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Design custom blocks with clear, predictable interfaces
Description: Students design custom blocks by first deciding what the block should do, what inputs (parameters) it needs, and what it should return (if anything) BEFORE writing the code inside. They choose clear, descriptive names for the block and its parameters so that other programmers (or their future selves) can use the block without reading its internal code. This "design the interface first" approach promotes reusable, maintainable code.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.03: Choose between adding a parameter vs. creating a separate block

ID: T11.G6.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Evaluate and critique custom block designs
Description: Students evaluate examples of custom block designs (some good, some poor) and critique them based on multiple criteria: clarity of purpose, reusability, naming conventions, appropriate parameter choices, and correct return value usage. They identify specific problems (e.g., "This block does too many unrelated things," "The parameter name 'x' is unclear," "This should return a value instead of setting a variable") and suggest concrete improvements with justifications.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.03: Choose between adding a parameter vs. creating a separate block


ID: T11.G7.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures

* T11.G6.04: Evaluate and critique custom block designs


ID: T11.G7.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand encapsulation and information hiding
Description: Students understand the principle of encapsulation: a well-designed custom block acts like a "black box" where users only need to know WHAT it does (its interface: name, parameters, return value) and not HOW it does it (the implementation inside). They compare examples of blocks with clear, self-contained interfaces versus blocks that require users to know internal details (like specific variable names used inside). This "information hiding" principle makes code easier to use, understand, and modify, because changes to the internal implementation won't break code that calls the block.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.01: Design custom blocks with clear, predictable interfaces
* T11.G6.03: Refactor spaghetti code into organized custom blocks

They understand that the game world exists on the host's computer and is shared with clients - if the host leaves, the game ends for everyone. They diagram a simple host-client connection showing one host and 2-3 clients. They identify which player is the host in a running game by checking who created it.

They understand that normal movement blocks (like "change x by 10") only affect their own screen, but synchronized blocks (like "synchronously set speed x 10 y 0") update everyone's screen. They create a test with two windows: use regular movement in one sprite and synchronized movement in another, then observe the difference (regular movement only shows in one window; synchronized movement shows in both windows). They explain why synchronization is necessary for fair multiplayer games (all players must see the same game state). They demonstrate by showing a teacher the difference between synchronized vs non-synchronized movement in a two-window test.

Skill: Understand what lag and latency mean in multiplayer games
Description: Students learn that "lag" or "latency" is the delay between when you do something and when you see the result in a multiplayer game. They understand that lag happens because messages must travel over the internet between players' computers, which takes time. They identify signs of lag in games (sprites jumping to new positions instead of moving smoothly, delayed reactions, actions happening out of order). They test a multiplayer game and recognize when lag is occurring. They understand that lag is worse when players are far apart or have slow internet connections.

Description: Students learn when to broadcast to "All Sprites" (including replicates) vs "Exclude Replicate" (originals only). They understand that "All Sprites" makes all copies of all sprites run the handler, while "Exclude Replicate" makes only original sprites (one per player) run it. They create a test with both modes and observe the difference in two windows. They choose "Exclude Replicate" when each player should do something once (like scoring: only one sprite per player should increase score), and "All Sprites" when every visible sprite should react (like playing animation: all sprites change appearance together). They demonstrate understanding by correctly identifying which mode to use for 3 different game events.

Unlike G7.05's single-scene focus, this capstone requires managing multiple scenes with consistent style (using G7.01 prompt templates), scene-to-scene navigation UI (prev/next buttons), and coordinated transitions. Students must track scene state (current scene number, scenes visited), implement navigation buttons, and ensure visual/audio consistency across all scenes. This is a complex integration project requiring planning, implementation, testing, and iteration.
CSTA: 3B-AP-16

Implementation Guidance: Teachers should provide starter template with scene array structure [sceneName, narration, imagePrompt, audioFile] and navigation button framework. Students focus on AI content generation and synchronization.
