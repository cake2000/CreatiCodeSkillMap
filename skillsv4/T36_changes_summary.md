**Total Skills:** 40 (K through Grade 8)
**Skills Modified:** 11 skills

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed Phase 1 optimization of topic T36, fixing all HIGH and MEDIUM priority issues while preserving all external dependencies and maintaining skill integrity. No skills were deleted.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Inappropriate Coding Dependencies (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Three collaboration/career skills incorrectly depended on coding constructs (loops, variables) that weren't relevant to the skill objectives.

**Fixed:**
- **T36.G3.01** (Ask classmates simple questions): Removed dependency on T07.G3.01 (loops)
- **T36.G3.02** (Draft team agreements): Removed dependency on T09.G3.01 (variables)
- **T36.G5.02** (Plan-build-feedback cycle): Removed dependency on T07.G3.01 (loops)

**Rationale:** These skills focus on communication, collaboration, and process design—not on implementing coding constructs. The dependencies were conceptual mismatches.

---

### 2. Fixed Foundation Dependencies (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Some G2 skills referenced unrelated T01 (algorithms) skills instead of building on T36's own career awareness progression.

**Fixed:**
- **T36.G1.01** (List jobs that rely on computers): Added dependency on T36.GK.03 (digital tools awareness)
- **T36.G2.01** (Identify project roles): Changed from T01.G1.10 to T36.G1.01 (career awareness)
- **T36.G2.03** (Recognize teammates' strengths): Changed from T01.G1.10 to T36.G2.01 (project roles)

**Rationale:** Creates a coherent progression within T36 from basic digital tool awareness → job/career awareness → project roles → team collaboration.

---

### 3. Fixed X-2 Rule Violation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** T36.G6.04 (Grade 6) depended on T36.G3.02 (Grade 3), violating the X-2 rule (max 2-grade gap).

**Fixed:**
- **T36.G6.04** (Add ethics clauses): Removed T36.G3.02 dependency; kept only T36.G5.02

**Rationale:** T36.G5.02 (Grade 5) provides the necessary foundation for ethics clauses, maintaining proper scaffolding without the 3-grade gap violation.

---

### 4. Removed Redundant Parent Dependencies (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Sub-skills (e.g., T36.G6.01.01, T36.G6.01.02) redundantly listed parent skills as dependencies.

**Fixed:**
- **T36.G6.01.01**: Removed T36.G6.01 (parent skill assumed)
- **T36.G6.01.02**: Removed T36.G6.01 (parent skill assumed)
- **T36.G7.01.01**: Removed T36.G7.01 (parent skill assumed)
- **T36.G7.01.02**: Removed T36.G7.01 (parent skill assumed)

**Rationale:** Parent skills are implicitly prerequisite; listing them creates unnecessary dependency clutter.

---

### 5. Enhanced Skill Descriptions (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Some skills were overly broad without concrete deliverables.

**Enhanced:**
- **T36.G3.01**: Added "practice collaborative inquiry skills like active listening and asking follow-up questions"
- **T36.G3.02**: Added "Teams discuss and agree on specific collaboration practices like decision-making processes and conflict resolution approaches"
- **T36.G5.02**: Added "Students practice the iterative design process by gathering user feedback and making improvements based on observations"
- **T36.G6.01**: Added "create a summary chart showing 2-3 example jobs, 3-4 key skills needed, and typical tools/technologies used"
- **T36.G7.01**: Added "prepare at least 5 interview questions and create a written summary or presentation"
- **T36.G8.03**: Added "create a comparison chart showing at least 3 job categories affected by AI, with specific examples and research sources"

**Rationale:** Makes skills more concrete, actionable, and assessable with clear deliverables.
