Skill: Add a note to explain a section of a plan
Description: Students add a short note near a group of steps to explain why that section is there (e.g., "These steps are to get ready," "These steps are to clean up"). This is an unplugged analogue of commenting and documenting parts of a project.

ID: T12.G2.02
Topic: T12 – Organizing Programs
Skill: Fix confusing labels on a plan
Description: Students see a simple plan with section titles that are vague or unclear (e.g., "Stuff," "More things") and replace them with clearer titles that match the steps underneath (e.g., "Set up chairs," "Decorate the room"). This mirrors renaming confusing identifiers but stays at the level of everyday language.

ID: T12.G2.03
Topic: T12 – Organizing Programs
Skill: Use the same style for section titles
Description: Students review several section titles for one plan (e.g., "Set up," "Playing the game," "Clean up time!") and adjust or choose options so they all follow a similar style (for example, all starting with action words). This builds awareness of consistent naming without introducing code vocabulary.

ID: T12.G2.04
Topic: T12 – Organizing Programs
Skill: Group related steps under a heading
Description: Students see 2–3 headings (e.g., "Before class," "During class," "After class") and a mixed set of picture steps, then group each step under the heading where it belongs. This extends the Grade 1 idea of splitting lists into clearly labeled sections.

Topic: T12 – Organizing Programs
Skill: Write a comment explaining a complex block
Description: Students add their first comment to a block that is not immediately obvious in purpose (e.g., a simple loop or condition).

ID: T12.G3.02
Topic: T12 – Organizing Programs
Skill: Create a header comment for a script

This is a first step toward external documentation.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Spot a missing or wrong action
Description: Students watch a short picture story or animation and compare what happens to what was supposed to happen (e.g., the character should jump but doesn't, or moves the wrong direction). They point to the step that is missing or incorrect without needing to fix it yet.

ID: T13.GK.02
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Try again when the steps don't work
Description: Students follow a simple set of picture steps for a task (e.g., stacking blocks, moving a character on a board) and notice when the result is not what was intended. They experience the idea of "try, check, then try again" without needing to know how to change the steps themselves.

ID: T13.GK.03
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Fix a single wrong direction or action in steps
Description: Students “play computer” by acting out or watching a character follow a short list of picture steps to reach a fun goal (like a treasure or door). When the character ends up in the wrong place or does something silly, they identify which one movement is wrong (e.g., an arrow pointing left instead of right, or “sit down” too early) and swap it for a better step so the routine works.

ID: T13.G1.01
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Identify where a step is wrong
Description: Students look at a set of picture‑based steps that, when “played out” as a story, clearly go wrong (e.g., “jump before moving” when the intent is move‑then‑jump). They select or highlight the step that causes the problem without yet fixing everything.

ID: T13.G1.02
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Change a number to fix a repeated action

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Fix a repeated step that happens too many or too few times
