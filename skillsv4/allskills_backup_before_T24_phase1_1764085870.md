Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use a manual loop counter variable
Description: Students create and use a counter variable that they manually increment on each loop iteration (e.g., to show "Step 1, Step 2, …" or to track how many loops have run). They initialize the counter before the loop (set counter to 0), then use a `change counter by 1` block inside a repeat loop.

Skill: Use a basic for-loop with start, limit, and step
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `for [variable] from (START) to (LIMIT) at step (S)` block to create loops with automatic counters. They learn that for-loops provide a built-in loop variable that automatically increments, eliminating the need to manually initialize and increment counters. Start with simple cases using step 1 and various start/limit values (e.g., from 1 to 10, from 0 to 5). Students understand this as a cleaner alternative to manual counter variables.

Description: Students practice using for-loops with different step sizes to count by 2s, 5s, 10s, or other increments. For example: loop from 0 to 20 step 2 to get even numbers, or from 5 to 50 step 5 to count by fives. They apply this to create patterns, animations with varying spacing, or generate sequences for calculations. This reinforces understanding of the step parameter and multiplication patterns.

ID: T07.G4.03.03
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use for-loops to count backwards
Description: Students use negative step values in for-loops to count backwards (e.g., from 10 to 1 step -1 for a countdown, or from 100 to 0 step -5). They understand that when step is negative, the start value should be larger than the limit value. Common applications include countdown timers, reverse animations, or processing items in reverse order. This completes their understanding of for-loop flexibility.

Description: Students use CreatiCode's `repeat (N) times at intervals of (T)` block to create animations where actions happen with visible pauses between them (e.g., a countdown timer showing 3...2...1, a character blinking every 0.5 seconds, or a sprite moving in discrete steps). This block automatically handles timing without needing a `wait` block inside the loop, making code cleaner and timing more precise.

ID: T07.G5.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Simulate repeated experiments with a loop
Description: Students simulate a simple chance experiment repeatedly in code using a loop, and use counter variables to track outcomes and observe frequencies. For example: roll a die 100 times and count how many times each number appears; flip a coin 50 times and track heads vs. tails; or spin a spinner repeatedly to see if outcomes match expected probabilities.

Skill: Build simple nested loops
Description: Students write their first nested loop structure by placing one loop inside another. Start with concrete tasks like creating a simple grid pattern (e.g., 3 rows of 4 stamps each) or repeating a short sequence multiple times. The outer loop controls how many groups, the inner loop controls repetitions within each group. Use small fixed counts (2-4 iterations each) and visual feedback to make the nested structure clear. This scaffolding skill prepares students for analyzing variable bounds in nested loops.

ID: T07.G6.01
Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace nested loops with variable bounds
Description: Students analyze code with nested loops where the inner loop bound depends on the outer loop counter (e.g., `for i from 1 to n` outer, `repeat (n - i)` inner). The key challenge is understanding that the inner loop executes a different number of times for each outer iteration, requiring calculation to predict total iterations. Unlike G4.07's constant bounds, students must reason about changing iteration counts and track how the loop variable affects inner bounds.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Refactor complex repeated patterns into loops with variables
Description: Students refactor longer scripts where the repeated segments have slight variations (e.g., "move 10, move 20, move 30" becomes a loop with a changing variable). Unlike G4.04's identical repetitions, this requires using a for-loop to handle the pattern. Students analyze the variation pattern and express it mathematically (e.g., recognizing that "10, 20, 30" follows the pattern `i * 10` where i goes from 1 to 3). This develops competition-level generalization skills.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Loop‑based search in a list
Description: Students implement a simple linear search using a for-each loop to find the first item in a list that matches a target (e.g., find the first score above 90), and then respond (e.g., report the position or value).

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Trace nested loops with abstract calculations using trace tables
Description: Students use trace tables to systematically track variable values through nested loops that perform abstract calculations (e.g., computing sums, products, or counts). They create a table with columns for each variable (outer counter, inner counter, accumulator) and rows for each iteration, filling in values step-by-step. Focus is on loops where the output is numerical rather than spatial. Examples include: calculating factorial with nested loops, summing products of row/column indices, or counting items that meet complex conditions. This methodical approach is essential for debugging complex loop logic and succeeding in programming competitions.

Skill: Trace nested loops that generate spatial patterns
Description: Students trace nested loops that produce visual/spatial output where row and column counters control position (e.g., drawing a checkerboard, creating a grid of stamps, or generating triangle patterns). They predict the visual result by understanding how loop iteration numbers map to spatial coordinates (x, y positions). Unlike G6.05's focus on abstract calculations, this skill connects loop tracing to concrete spatial reasoning. Students may use trace tables but the emphasis is on visualizing the 2D output pattern, not just tracking numerical values.

Description: Students implement loops that repeatedly update a variable based on its previous value (e.g., adding interest each year, reducing health points each turn, or growing/shrinking a value by a percentage). This bridges statistical simulations to physics-based motion by focusing on the concept of iterative state change.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use break to exit a loop early
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `break` block to exit a loop immediately when a specific condition is met, without completing all planned iterations. Common applications include: stopping a search loop once the target item is found, exiting a game loop when a win/lose condition occurs, or terminating input collection when a sentinel value is entered. Students learn that break makes code more efficient by avoiding unnecessary iterations and clearer than complex nested conditionals.

Topic: T07 – Loops
Skill: Use continue to skip loop iterations
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `continue` block to skip the rest of the current iteration and immediately start the next one. This is useful for filtering or conditional processing, such as: skipping invalid items in a list without processing them, ignoring even numbers when processing odds, or bypassing error cases without stopping the loop. Students understand that continue is clearer than wrapping the entire loop body in an if statement.

Skill: Use for-each item to iterate over list values
Description: Students use CreatiCode's `for each item [variable] in [list]` block to process all items in a list sequentially, with the loop variable taking on each value. For example: say each word in a sentence list, draw each number from a score list, or check each name for a match. Students learn when for-each loops are clearer than manually indexed loops because they focus on values rather than positions. This is especially useful when the item's value matters but its position doesn't.

This variant is useful when: you need both the position and value (access via "item [index] of [list]"), you want to modify list items in place, or you need to work with corresponding positions in multiple lists. Students compare when to use for-each item (value-focused) vs for-each index (position-focused).

## GRADE 8 (8 skills)

ID: T10.G8.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use nested loops to compare data across two tables
Description: Students write nested loops to analyze relationships between two tables (e.g., matching orders to customers, finding common elements). The outer loop iterates through one table while the inner loop searches the other table for matches.

Dependencies:
* T07.G5.01: Simulate repeated experiments with a loop
* T10.G6.04: Use table lookup to find related data


ID: T10.G8.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement bubble sort algorithm step by step
Description: Students implement bubble sort by writing nested loops: the outer loop controls passes, the inner loop compares adjacent items and swaps if out of order. They trace through the algorithm to understand how items "bubble" to their correct positions.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.10: Swap two items in a list
* T07.G6.01: Trace nested loops with variable bounds


ID: T10.G8.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement selection sort algorithm step by step
Description: Students implement selection sort by writing nested loops: the outer loop selects each position, the inner loop finds the minimum remaining element. They understand that selection sort makes fewer swaps than bubble sort.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.02: Implement bubble sort algorithm step by step
* T10.G4.07: Find the maximum or minimum item in a list manually


ID: T10.G8.04
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Build a simulation using table-based state
Description: Students create a simulation (e.g., a game with multiple entities, a population model, an ecosystem) where entities and their properties are stored in a table. Each simulation step loops through rows to update values based on rules.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.03: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario
* T10.G5.07: Loop through table rows to compute aggregates


ID: T10.G8.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Query and report statistics from a complex dataset
Description: Students work with a realistic multi-column table (e.g., weather data, sports statistics, survey results) and write code to answer analytical questions: compute means, find percentiles, compare groups, identify trends, and format results as a report.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.07: Analyze a dataset to find patterns or outliers
* T10.G6.01: Sort a table by a column


ID: T10.G8.06
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Model relationships using multiple linked tables
Description: Students design and use multiple tables that reference each other (e.g., a Students table and a Grades table linked by student ID). They write code to perform lookups across tables to answer queries like "What are all grades for student X?"

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.01: Use nested loops to compare data across two tables
* T10.G7.03: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario


ID: T10.G8.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement a hash table lookup using lists
Description: Students simulate a simple hash table by using a list where each position corresponds to a hash value computed using modulo operation (e.g., hash(key) = key mod list_length for numbers, or sum of character codes mod list_length for strings). They handle collisions using linear probing (check next positions) or chaining (store multiple items at one position using lists within lists). Implementation pattern: Use a list as the hash table, create a hash function using math operators and string blocks, use linear search as fallback for collisions, and compare performance to linear search to demonstrate the principle of constant-time lookup.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.03: Implement selection sort algorithm step by step
* T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches


ID: T10.G8.08
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use advanced list operations for algorithm optimization
Description: Students apply advanced list techniques to solve problems more efficiently than brute force approaches. They implement binary search on sorted lists to find items in O(log n) time instead of O(n) linear search by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. They use two-pointer techniques where pointers move from both ends toward the center to solve problems like finding pairs that sum to a target or removing duplicates from sorted lists. They apply sliding window algorithms to efficiently process contiguous subarrays by maintaining a window that slides through the data, useful for finding maximum sum subarrays, longest substrings, or moving averages. These techniques demonstrate how clever list manipulation can dramatically improve performance for common algorithmic patterns.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.02: Implement bubble sort algorithm step by step
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches

ID: T11.GK.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Group activities that belong together
Description: Students identify activities that naturally belong together as a group. For example, in a picture sequence showing "get ready for school," they circle all the steps about eating breakfast (get bowl, pour cereal, add milk, eat) as one group and all the steps about getting dressed as another group. This builds the foundational idea that actions can be organized into meaningful clusters before introducing the concept of naming or reusing these groups.

Assessment example: Given 12 picture cards showing a morning routine, students use colored circles to group related activities: breakfast steps in blue, getting dressed steps in green, brushing teeth steps in yellow.

Dependencies:
* T01.GK.03: Find the first and last pictures
* T03.GK.01: Identify parts that make up a whole

---

ID: T11.GK.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Name a group of activities
Description: Students practice giving a clear, descriptive name to a group of related activities. After grouping activities together (like in T11.GK.01), they choose a name that describes what the whole group does. For example, a group of steps about mixing ingredients might be called "Make the Batter" rather than vague names like "Step 1" or "The First Part."

Assessment example: Given three groups of picture cards (1: wash hands, put on apron, get ingredients; 2: mix, stir, pour; 3: put in oven, set timer, wait), students suggest appropriate names like "Get Ready," "Make the Batter," and "Bake the Cake."

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.01: Group activities that belong together

---

ID: T11.GK.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Use a named group in a bigger plan
Description: Students see how a named group of activities can be referenced by its name in a larger set of instructions. For example, instead of listing all breakfast steps again, a morning routine might just say "Do Breakfast" as one step. This introduces the core idea of abstraction: once you name a group, you can refer to the whole group by that single name.

Assessment example: Students create a simplified "Get Ready for School" plan with just three steps: "Do Breakfast," "Get Dressed," "Pack Backpack," where each step represents a group of activities they previously organized.

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.02: Name a group of activities

---

ID: T11.G1.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Find repeated groups of activities
Description: Students examine a longer picture-based activity plan and identify when the same group of actions appears multiple times. For example, in a "classroom game" sequence, they might notice that "reset the game board" (put pieces back, shuffle cards, reset timer) happens before each round. This builds recognition of repetition at the group level, not just single actions.

Assessment example: Given a picture sequence for playing three rounds of a board game, students circle the "setup" activities that appear before each round, recognizing that the same group of actions repeats.

Dependencies:
* T11.GK.03: Use a named group in a bigger plan
* T04.G1.01: Notice when steps repeat in a sequence

---

ID: T11.G1.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Create labels for repeated activity groups
Description: Students create a label or title for a group of activities that repeats, so they can refer to it by name instead of drawing or listing the same steps multiple times. This introduces the practical benefit of naming: it saves time and reduces clutter when the same sequence is needed in multiple places.

Assessment example: After identifying that "clean workspace" (wipe table, throw away trash, put supplies away) happens multiple times in an art project, students create a "Clean Workspace" label card they can place in the sequence wherever needed.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.01: Find repeated groups of activities
* T11.GK.02: Name a group of activities

---

ID: T11.G1.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Use a label to replace repeated activity groups
Description: Students simplify a complex picture-based plan by replacing repeated activity groups with their labels. Where they previously had the full sequence of steps repeated, they now place just the label card. This demonstrates how abstraction reduces complexity and makes plans easier to read and follow.

Assessment example: Students take a 20-step picture sequence for a class activity that has three repeated "clean up" sections and replace each with a single "Clean Up" label card, reducing the sequence to 14 steps plus the definition of "Clean Up."

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.02: Create labels for repeated activity groups

---

ID: T11.G1.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Recognize the need for different versions of similar groups
Description: Students identify when activity groups are similar but not identical, requiring different labels. For example, "Set Up for Game 1" and "Set Up for Game 2" involve similar activities but with different materials. This introduces the idea that sometimes you need multiple related groups rather than one group with variations.

Assessment example: Given a sequence for running two different classroom games, students identify that both games have "setup" phases but decide whether to create "Setup Game 1" and "Setup Game 2" labels or find what's common enough for a single "Setup Game" label.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.03: Use a label to replace repeated activity groups

---

ID: T11.G2.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Identify when to create activity groups for organization
Description: Students decide whether to group activities based on organization benefits, not just repetition. Some groups of activities should be named and separated even if they only happen once, because they represent distinct responsibilities or phases. For example, "Check Safety Rules" might happen only once at the start but deserves its own label for clarity.

Assessment example: Given a field trip plan, students identify which activity groups should get labels: some because they repeat (like "count students"), others because they're important distinct phases (like "review safety rules" or "board the bus") even though they happen only once.

Dependencies:
* T11.G1.04: Recognize the need for different versions of similar groups
* T03.G2.01: Choose subtasks for a simple project idea

---

ID: T11.G2.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Create multiple labeled groups that work together
Description: Students organize a moderately complex activity plan into 3-5 labeled groups that work together to accomplish the overall goal. They identify natural boundaries between groups and give each a clear name. This builds decomposition skills: breaking a large plan into a coordinated set of smaller, named pieces.

Assessment example: For a "make and serve snacks" activity, students create labels for: "Wash Hands," "Prepare Snacks," "Set Table," "Serve Snacks," "Clean Up," showing how each labeled group contributes to the whole activity.

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.01: Identify when to create activity groups for organization
* T03.G2.02: Group subtasks by type

---

ID: T11.G2.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Explain dependencies between labeled groups
Description: Students identify and explain when one labeled group must happen before another, and when groups can happen in any order. They use simple language like "you must do Wash Hands before Prepare Snacks" or "Set Table can happen before or after Prepare Snacks." This builds understanding of dependencies and sequencing at a higher level of abstraction.

Assessment example: Given 5 labeled activity groups for a class party, students create arrows or ordering notes showing which groups must happen in sequence and which can happen in flexible order, explaining their reasoning.

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.02: Create multiple labeled groups that work together
* T01.G2.01: Identify pictures that must stay in order vs those that can swap

---

ID: T11.G2.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Recognize when labeled groups can be reused in different plans
Description: Students identify labeled activity groups that could be useful in multiple different plans, not just the current one. For example, "Wash Hands" and "Clean Workspace" are useful in many different activities (art, science, cooking). This introduces the concept of reusable components: some groups are specific to one plan, while others are general-purpose.

Assessment example: After creating labeled groups for a cooking activity, students sort the labels into "only for cooking" (like "Mix Ingredients") and "useful for other activities" (like "Wash Hands" or "Clean Up"), suggesting other activities where the reusable labels could be used.

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.02: Create multiple labeled groups that work together

---

ID: T11.G2.05
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Describe the purpose of each labeled group
Description: Students write or explain in one sentence what each labeled activity group is meant to accomplish and why it's part of the overall plan. This focuses on the WHAT and WHY (the group's purpose and role) rather than HOW (the specific steps inside). This thinking skill prepares students to design and document custom blocks with clear purposes.

Assessment example: For a classroom activity broken into labeled groups, students complete sentences like "The Setup Group gets everything ready so we can start the activity" and "The Practice Group helps us learn the new skill before we try it ourselves."

Dependencies:
* T11.G2.02: Create multiple labeled groups that work together
* T02.G2.01: Turn a picture routine into labeled boxes

---

ID: T11.G3.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand when to use custom blocks vs loops
Description: Students identify scenarios where a custom block (called "My Block" in CreatiCode) is more appropriate than a loop. They recognize that loops repeat the SAME action multiple times, while custom blocks group a SEQUENCE of different actions for reuse or organization. Given example scripts or problems, they choose the better organizational approach and explain their reasoning. This conceptual gateway skill builds organizational thinking without requiring students to define custom blocks yet.

Assessment example: Present 3-4 scenarios (e.g., "draw a house," "move 10 steps 5 times," "reset game state," "count to 10"). Students label each as better solved with a loop or a custom block and explain why.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple loop
* T01.G3.12: Predict the final state of a simple algorithm

---

ID: T11.G3.00
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Distinguish custom blocks from built-in blocks
Description: Students learn that CreatiCode has two types of blocks: built-in blocks (provided by CreatiCode, like "move 10 steps" or "say Hello") and custom blocks (created by programmers, found in the "My Blocks" category). They examine several example projects and identify which blocks are custom (defined by the programmer) versus built-in (provided by the system). They understand that custom blocks are tools programmers create to organize their own code.

Assessment example: Given a script with 8-10 blocks including some from "Motion," "Looks," and "My Blocks" categories, students identify which blocks are custom (from My Blocks) and which are built-in, explaining how they can tell.

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T02.G3.01: Match a short block script to the right task

---

ID: T11.G3.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Use a pre-made custom block with parameters
Description: Students use an existing custom block (e.g., `call DrawRectangle [50] [30]` or `call MoveSprite [100] [200]`) provided in a starter project, and experiment with different argument values to see how the block's behavior changes. They learn that arguments (values in square brackets when calling) let one block handle many situations. Students do not create the block themselves yet; they explore how calling a pre-made block with different values produces different results.

Assessment example: Given a starter project with `call DrawShape [sides] [size]`, students try different values like `call DrawShape [3] [50]` for a triangle and `call DrawShape [6] [30]` for a hexagon, observing how the same block creates different shapes.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.00: Distinguish custom blocks from built-in blocks
* T08.G3.02: Decide when a single if is enough
* T09.G3.01.04: Display variable value on stage using the variable monitor

---

ID: T11.G3.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Identify repeated or grouped actions that could become custom blocks
Description: Students examine a longer script (15-30 blocks) that is ALREADY WRITTEN and identify groups of blocks that appear multiple times OR represent distinct behaviors. They draw boxes around these groups and label each with a descriptive name (e.g., "ResetPlayer," "CheckWinCondition"). This builds the habit of recognizing natural custom block boundaries IN EXISTING CODE before actually creating them. This is ANALYSIS of existing code, as opposed to DESIGN before coding (covered in G5.01.01).

Assessment example: Given a 20-block script for a maze game, students circle and label groups like "move character," "check wall collision," and "update score display," explaining why each group makes sense as a potential custom block.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.02: Use a pre-made custom block with parameters
* T09.G3.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
* T08.G3.03: Pick the right conditional block for a scenario

---

ID: T11.G3.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Identify reporter blocks in existing code
Description: Students learn to recognize reporter blocks (blocks with rounded shapes that fit inside input slots) versus command blocks (blocks that perform actions and stack vertically). Using existing CreatiCode projects, they identify reporter blocks like `(pick random 1 to 10)`, `(distance to [sprite])`, or `(x position)` and observe where these blocks can be used (inside input slots of other blocks). This prepares students to understand return values from custom reporter blocks in later grades.

Assessment example: Given 10-12 different blocks from various categories, students sort them into "reporter blocks" (rounded, return a value) and "command blocks" (rectangular, do an action) and show one example of where each type can be used in a script.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.03: Identify repeated or grouped actions that could become custom blocks
* T09.G3.04: Debug a single missing or wrong variable block
* T07.G3.04: Use repeat-until to reach a simple goal

---

ID: T11.G3.05.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Explore the "Make a Block" interface basics
Description: Students open CreatiCode's "My Blocks" category, click "Make a Block," and explore the basic interface. They type a simple block name (without parameters, like "ResetGame" or "JumpUp") and observe the preview of how the block will look. After clicking OK, they see the `define (ResetGame)` hat block appear, understanding this is where they would add the block's code. They practice this process 2-3 times with different names, exploring without completing full implementations yet.

Assessment example: Students open the "Make a Block" dialog, type three different simple block names like "StartGame", "ShowMenu", and "PlaySound", observe each preview, click OK to see the define block appear, then delete them without adding code inside.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.04: Identify reporter blocks in existing code
* T07.G3.04: Use repeat-until to reach a simple goal
* T09.G3.01.04: Display variable value on stage using the variable monitor

---

ID: T11.G3.05.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Add one parameter to a custom block interface
Description: Students extend their exploration of the "Make a Block" interface by adding a single parameter using parentheses notation. They type block names with one input like `DrawSquare (size)` or `SayMessage (text)` and observe how the parameter appears in both the preview and the resulting `define (DrawSquare (size))` hat block. They understand that text in parentheses becomes an input slot that will receive values when the block is called.

Assessment example: Students create 2-3 custom block interfaces with one parameter each (like `Jump (height)`, `MoveForward (distance)`, `SetSpeed (speed)`), observing the preview and define block for each, then cancel or delete without implementing the blocks.

Dependencies:
* T11.G3.05.01: Explore the "Make a Block" interface basics

---

ID: T11.G4.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Define and call a simple custom block (no parameters)
Description: Students create their first complete custom block with no inputs (e.g., `ResetPlayer`) using CreatiCode's "Make a Block" button. In the dialog, they type just the block name. After clicking OK, a `define (ResetPlayer)` hat block appears where they add 3-5 blocks inside the definition. To run the custom block, they use `call ResetPlayer` from a main script. Students compare the before/after organization to see how custom blocks improve readability by grouping related actions under a meaningful name.

Assessment example: Students create a `SetupGame` custom block that goes to x:0 y:0, sets score to 0, and shows the sprite. They then call it from the green flag script using `call SetupGame`, verifying that the grouped actions execute when called.

Dependencies:
* T03.G2.01: Choose subtasks for a simple project idea
* T03.G2.02: Group subtasks by type
* T04.G2.03: Compare a long explicit description vs a compressed "repeat" description
* T06.G2.03: Design a simple "if-then" game rule
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T11.G3.05.01: Explore the "Make a Block" interface basics

---

ID: T11.G4.01.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Call a custom block from multiple places
Description: Students practice the key benefit of custom blocks: reuse. They create one custom block definition (like `ResetPlayer` or `ClearScreen`) and call it from 2-3 different places in their program (e.g., from the green flag script at startup, from a "game over" script, from a "restart" button). They verify that changing the definition once updates the behavior everywhere it's called, demonstrating the power of abstraction.

Assessment example: Students create a `ShowWelcomeMessage` custom block that says "Welcome!" and sets the sprite to x:0 y:0. They call this block from both the green flag event and when the space key is pressed, verifying that the same behavior happens in both places.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.01: Define and call a simple custom block (no parameters)

---

ID: T11.G4.02
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Distinguish command blocks from reporter blocks
Description: Students learn to recognize which blocks DO something (command/stack blocks that perform actions) and which blocks RETURN a value (reporter blocks with rounded shapes). In CreatiCode, command blocks stack vertically in scripts and are called with `call BlockName`, while reporter blocks fit inside input slots. Students categorize a set of BUILT-IN blocks first, understanding the two types before learning about custom reporters with `report` syntax in Grade 5.

Assessment example: Given 10 built-in blocks (mix of commands like "move 10 steps" and reporters like "(x position)" or "(pick random 1 to 10)"), students categorize them as "command blocks" (do something) or "reporter blocks" (return a value) and for each explain where it can be used.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.01: Define and call a simple custom block (no parameters)
* T04.G2.01: Identify the repeating unit in a longer pattern
* T04.G2.02: Spot repeated step sequences in everyday algorithms
* T07.G2.01: Identify when to use "repeat" vs "do once"
* T09.G3.01.04: Display variable value on stage using the variable monitor
* T11.G3.04: Identify reporter blocks in existing code

---

ID: T11.G4.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Use a built-in reporter block's result in a calculation or condition
Description: Students call built-in reporter blocks (like `(pick random 1 to 10)`, `(distance to [sprite])`, `(length of [list])`) and use their returned values directly in conditions or arithmetic expressions (e.g., `if <(distance to [sprite]) < 50>`, `set x to ((pick random 1 to 10) + 5)`). They practice chaining and nesting multiple reporters together in compound expressions, understanding that reporters can be nested inside other blocks' input slots. This prepares them to create their own custom reporter blocks in Grade 5.

Assessment example: Students create a script that uses `if <(distance to [Cat]) < 100>` to detect when the player is near an enemy, combining the reporter block with a comparison operator.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.02: Distinguish command blocks from reporter blocks
* T04.G2.01: Identify the repeating unit in a longer pattern
* T04.G2.02: Spot repeated step sequences in everyday algorithms
* T07.G2.01: Identify when to use "repeat" vs "do once"
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01.04: Display variable value on stage using the variable monitor
* T11.G3.04: Identify reporter blocks in existing code

---

ID: T11.G4.03.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Nest reporter blocks inside other reporters
Description: Students practice nesting reporter blocks inside other reporter blocks to create more complex expressions. For example, they place `(pick random 1 to 10)` inside `(+ 5)` to create `((pick random 1 to 10) + 5)`, or nest `(length of [list])` inside `(* 2)` for calculations. This builds comfort with reporter composition, a key skill for using custom reporters later.

Assessment example: Students create expressions that nest 2-3 reporter blocks, such as `((x position) + ((pick random 1 to 10) * 5))` to add a random offset to the sprite's current position.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.03: Use a built-in reporter block's result in a calculation or condition

---

ID: T11.G4.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Describe the purpose of each custom block in a script
Description: Students read a script that uses several custom blocks (called with `call BlockName`) and write a one-sentence description of each block's PURPOSE (e.g., "The `call ResetPlayer` block resets the player to the starting position and clears the score"). They focus on WHAT each block does (its goal), not HOW it does it (implementation details). They also identify how blocks fit together in the program's overall structure (e.g., setup, game loop, scoring, ending).

Assessment example: Given a game script with blocks `call SetupGame`, `call MovePlayer`, `call CheckCollision`, and `call UpdateScore`, students write a sentence describing what each block does based on its name and context.

Dependencies:
* T11.G4.01: Define and call a simple custom block (no parameters)

Skill: Trace execution through a script with custom blocks
Description: Students trace step-by-step through a script that uses `call` blocks, predicting the order of execution. When the script reaches `call MyBlock`, students trace INTO the custom block definition, follow the blocks inside, then return to continue after the call. They number each block in execution order and track any variable changes. This LOW-LEVEL tracing (execution order) complements G4.04's HIGH-LEVEL understanding (purpose).

Assessment example: Given a script with `when green flag clicked` → `call Setup` → `call MainLoop`, students number all blocks in order: 1-3 in the main script, then 4-7 inside Setup's definition, then 8-12 inside MainLoop's definition.

Skill: Identify the argument block in a custom block definition
Description: Students examine a custom block definition with one parameter and identify the `(argument (name))` reporter block used inside the definition. They understand that this special reporter block represents "the value that gets passed in" when the block is called. They locate where the argument block appears in the definition and recognize it only works inside that definition.

Assessment example: Given a `define (DrawSquare (size))` block with several blocks inside including `move (argument (size)) steps`, students identify which block is the argument block and explain that it retrieves the "size" value passed when calling the block.

Skill: Trace the flow of a parameter value through a custom block
Description: Students trace how a value passed during a `call` flows through a custom block definition via the `(argument (name))` block. For example, with `define (SayTwice (message))` containing `say (argument (message))` and `wait 1 seconds` and `say (argument (message))`, when students trace `call SayTwice [Hello]`, they identify that each `(argument (message))` evaluates to "Hello" at runtime. This builds understanding of parameter substitution.

Assessment example: Given `define (MoveAndTurn (distance))` with blocks `move (argument (distance)) steps` and `turn right ((argument (distance)) / 2) degrees`, students trace what happens when `call MoveAndTurn [60]` runs, showing that the first argument returns 60 and the second returns 30.

Skill: Define a custom block with one parameter
Description: Students create their first custom block with one input parameter using CreatiCode's "Make a Block" button. They type the block name with one parameter in parentheses like `DrawSquare (size)`. After clicking OK, a `define (DrawSquare (size))` hat block appears. Inside the definition, they use the `(argument (size))` reporter to access the parameter value. They call the block with different arguments like `call DrawSquare [50]` and `call DrawSquare [100]` to see how the parameter makes the block reusable for different sizes.

Assessment example: Students create `define (SayHello (name))` with `say (join [Hello, ] (argument (name)))` inside. They test it by calling `call SayHello [Alice]` and `call SayHello [Bob]`, verifying different outputs.

Skill: Call the same custom block with different parameter values
Description: Students practice the key value of parameters: one block definition can handle many different situations by changing the input values. They create one parameterized custom block and call it 3-5 times with different argument values, observing how the same code produces different results based on the inputs. This reinforces understanding of parameters as "customization points" that make blocks more versatile.

Assessment example: Students create `define (DrawPolygon (sides))` and call it multiple times: `call DrawPolygon [3]` (triangle), `call DrawPolygon [4]` (square), `call DrawPolygon [6]` (hexagon), `call DrawPolygon [8]` (octagon), seeing how one block creates all these shapes.

Description: Students test a newly created parameterized custom block by calling it with 2-3 different input values to verify it works as expected. They observe the sprite's behavior or output for each test case and confirm the block performs its intended action correctly. This introduces basic testing practices early, building habits of verification: try different values, check the result, identify if something doesn't work right.

Assessment example: After creating `define (MoveDistance (steps))`, students test it with `call MoveDistance [10]`, `call MoveDistance [50]`, and `call MoveDistance [100]`, observing that the sprite moves the correct distance each time.

Skill: Recognize when to use a parameter vs a fixed value
Description: Students analyze custom block scenarios and decide whether a value should be a parameter (input) or a fixed value (hardcoded in the block definition). They understand that values that need to change between different calls should be parameters, while values that stay the same can be fixed. For example, in a "JumpUp" block, the jump height might be a parameter, but the animation delay might be a fixed value.

Assessment example: Given 4-5 custom block scenarios like "play a sound effect" (should the sound name be a parameter?) or "reset player position" (should the starting position be a parameter?), students decide which values should be parameters and explain their reasoning.

Description: Given a project description (e.g., "make a simple quiz game"), students identify 2-3 distinct main responsibilities or phases that would each make a good custom block (e.g., "show question," "check answer," "update score"). This preliminary decomposition skill helps students see major functional boundaries before detailed planning. Students explain what each responsibility does, preparing for more detailed decomposition in T11.G5.01.02.

Assessment example: Given "Create a platformer game," students identify 3 main responsibilities like "player movement," "collision detection," and "level progression," explaining briefly what each area involves.

Description: Students take a project description and create a complete plan showing 4-6 custom blocks with clear names and brief descriptions of each block's responsibility. This is problem decomposition BEFORE coding—students plan the custom block structure first, then implement. They ensure each block has a single clear purpose and the blocks work together to accomplish the project goal. They may sketch or write out how the blocks will be called and interact.

Assessment example: Given "Create a pet care game," students plan custom blocks like `FeedPet (foodType)`, `PlayWithPet (activity)`, `CheckHealth`, `UpdateMood`, `ShowStatus`, explaining what each block does and which blocks call others.

Skill: Create 2-3 parameterized custom blocks for a small project
Description: Students implement a small project (10-15 blocks total) that uses 2-3 custom blocks with parameters. Each block should have 1-2 parameters and be called from at least one place. They practice creating the definitions using the `define` block, implementing the logic inside using `argument` blocks, and calling the blocks using the `call` syntax with appropriate arguments. This introduces coordinated use of multiple custom blocks.

Assessment example: Students create a simple drawing tool with two custom blocks: `define (DrawLine (length))` and `define (ChangeColor (colorName))`. They use these blocks together to draw a pattern with different colored lines of various lengths.

They call the same custom block with different parameter values in multiple places, showing that one flexible block definition can handle many similar situations. They explain how this reduces code duplication and makes the program easier to understand and modify.

Assessment example: Students create `define (DrawPolygon (sides) (size))` and use it throughout a drawing program: `call DrawPolygon [3] [50]` for triangles, `call DrawPolygon [4] [60]` for squares, `call DrawPolygon [6] [40]` for hexagons, demonstrating that one block handles all regular polygons.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Match parameter names to argument values when calling custom blocks
Description: Students trace how argument values passed during a `call` block correspond to parameter names in the custom block definition by position. For `define (DrawRect (width) (height))` called with `call DrawRect [100] [50]`, students identify that 100 maps to `width` and 50 maps to `height`. They practice with blocks having 2-3 parameters, understanding that arguments are matched by POSITION (first argument to first parameter, etc.) not by name.

Assessment example: Given `define (MoveAndSay (x) (y) (message))` and `call MoveAndSay [100] [200] [Hello]`, students identify which value each parameter receives and predict what each `(argument (...))` block would return inside the definition.

They examine calls to custom blocks where the arguments are swapped or misplaced, predict the incorrect behavior, then fix the call to pass arguments in the correct order. This reinforces understanding that argument position matters and builds debugging skills for a common mistake.

Assessment example: Given `define (CreatePlayer (name) (color) (size))` and a buggy call `call CreatePlayer [30] [red] [Alice]`, students identify that the arguments are in wrong positions, predict the bug (size gets "Alice", name gets 30, etc.), and write the corrected call `call CreatePlayer [Alice] [red] [30]`.

Description: Students analyze scenarios and decide whether to add a parameter to an existing custom block OR create separate blocks. For example: should `DrawRectangle` have a color parameter (`DrawRectangle (width) (height) (color)`), or should there be separate `DrawRedRectangle` and `DrawBlueRectangle` blocks? They justify design choices: parameters are better when the variation is continuous/has many possible values; separate blocks may be clearer when there are few fixed options.

Assessment example: For "play different sound effects in a game," students decide between `PlaySound (soundName)` vs separate `PlayJumpSound`, `PlayCoinSound`, `PlayGameOverSound` blocks, and explain their reasoning based on how many sounds there are and whether new sounds will be added.

Description: Students examine a larger project (game, animation, simulation) and identify how it uses custom blocks to organize functionality into major components. They explain how this modular design makes the code easier to understand, modify, and debug compared to a non-modular version. They create a diagram or outline showing the major custom blocks and their relationships (which blocks call which other blocks).

Assessment example: Given a complete game project with 6-8 custom blocks, students create a structure diagram showing the main script at the top, which blocks it calls directly, and which helper blocks are called by those blocks, explaining how the organization improves clarity.

Inside the definition, they access each parameter using the `argument` block for each parameter name. They practice ordering parameters logically and using clear parameter names. They call the block with various argument combinations, testing that each parameter works correctly.

Assessment example: Students create `define (DrawRectangle (width) (height) (color))` with code that uses all three parameters. They test with calls like `call DrawRectangle [100] [50] [red]` and `call DrawRectangle [80] [120] [blue]`.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Decide whether a custom block should be a command or reporter
Description: Students analyze scenarios and decide whether a custom block should perform an action (command block, use `call`) or return a value (reporter block, use `report` with `return`). For example, "DrawCircle" should be a command (it does something visual), while "CalculateArea" should be a reporter (it computes and returns a number). They justify their design choice based on whether the block DOES something or COMPUTES something. This introduces the concept of custom reporters before implementing them in T11.G5.08.

Assessment example: Given 6-8 custom block scenarios (e.g., "move sprite to position," "calculate distance between sprites," "draw polygon," "find maximum value," "reset game state," "check if player won"), students categorize each as command or reporter and explain their reasoning.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Define a custom reporter block that returns a value
Description: Students create a custom block that returns a value using CreatiCode's `return [value]` block inside the definition. For example, `define (Average (a) (b))` with a `return [((argument (a)) + (argument (b))) / 2]` block. To use the return value, they call the block with `report Average [10] [20]` instead of `call`, allowing the result to be used in expressions, conditions, or variable assignments.

Assessment example: Students create a custom reporter block `define (Maximum (a) (b))` that returns the larger of two numbers using an if-else block and two return blocks. They test it in different contexts: `say (report Maximum [5] [3])`, `set score to (report Maximum [score] [0])`, and `if <(report Maximum [x] [y]) > 100>`.

Description: Students practice using the value returned by their custom reporter blocks in various contexts: inside other reporters, in conditional tests, in variable assignments, and nested inside other custom blocks. They demonstrate that custom reporters work just like built-in reporters—they can be placed anywhere a value is needed. This builds fluency with reporter composition and reinforces that well-designed reporters are versatile tools.

Assessment example: Students create `define (DistanceBetween (x1) (y1) (x2) (y2))` that returns the calculated distance. They use it in multiple ways: `say (report DistanceBetween [0] [0] [100] [100])`, `if <(report DistanceBetween [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2]) < 50>`, and `set closestDistance to (report DistanceBetween [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2])`.

Common errors include: wrong argument values, missing calls, arguments in wrong order, using `call` when `report` is needed (or vice versa), wrong number of arguments, or calling a block before it's defined. They fix each bug and test that the corrected script works properly.

Assessment example: Given a script with bugs like `call MoveSprite [100]` (missing second argument), `set x to (call GetPosition)` (should use `report`), and `call DrawShape [red] [5]` (arguments swapped), students identify each bug, explain the problem, and write the correct version.

Skill: Create custom blocks with mixed text labels and parameters
Description: Students create custom blocks that include both descriptive text labels AND input parameters to make the block read like natural language. For example, `Move sprite (sprite) to x (x) y (y)` or `Set (variable) to random from (min) to (max)`. In CreatiCode's "Make a Block" dialog, they type the full block signature with text labels between parameters, making the block's purpose clear when used in scripts. This improves code readability by making block calls self-documenting.

Assessment example: Students create a block like `Draw (shape) with size (size) and color (color)` that reads naturally when called: `call Draw [square] with size [50] and color [red]`, making the code easy to understand at a glance.

They identify the duplicated sections, note any values that vary between duplications (potential parameters), and explain how creating a custom block would improve the code. This "code smell" detection skill helps students proactively recognize refactoring opportunities.

Skill: Choose clear, descriptive names for custom blocks
Description: Students practice naming custom blocks with clear, descriptive names that communicate the block's purpose. They evaluate name quality: good names use verbs for command blocks and noun phrases for reporters, are specific rather than vague, and follow consistent naming conventions. They compare weak names (like "Block1," "DoStuff," "X") with strong names (like "ResetPlayer," "CheckCollision," "CalculateScore") and explain why the strong names are better.

Assessment example: Given 8-10 poorly named custom blocks like "Go," "Thing," "Block2," "X," students suggest better names and explain their improvements. For example, "Go" might become "MoveToStartPosition" and "Thing" might become "UpdateHealthBar."

They consider parameter order (most important or natural reading order first) and avoid redundant parameters. They practice thinking through "what information does this block need from the caller?" and "what names make the block call easy to understand?"

Assessment example: For a block that should "move a sprite smoothly from its current position to a target position," students design the parameter list, deciding between options like `MoveTo (x) (y)` vs `MoveSprite (sprite) to (x) (y)` vs `MoveSmoothly (x) (y) (speed)`, explaining trade-offs for each design.

Description: Students design custom blocks by fully specifying the interface (name, parameters, return value if any, and purpose description) BEFORE writing the code inside. They complete a design template for 3-5 custom blocks: block name with parameters, what it does (one sentence), what each parameter means, what it returns (if anything). This "interface-first" design approach ensures blocks have clear, well-thought-out contracts before implementation, making them more reusable and maintainable.

Assessment example: For a "battle system" feature, students design interfaces: `Attack (attacker) (defender) returns: damage dealt`, `Heal (target) (amount) returns: actual healing (after max HP cap)`, `CheckDefeat (sprite) returns: true if HP <= 0`, completing a design document before any coding.

Skill: Verify custom block independence and isolation
Description: Students verify that their custom blocks are properly independent—changing one block's internal implementation doesn't break other blocks as long as the interface (name, parameters, return value) stays the same. They demonstrate this by modifying a block's internals (changing how it accomplishes its goal) while keeping the interface the same, and showing that the rest of the program still works correctly. This teaches the value of abstraction and encapsulation.

Assessment example: Students modify the internal implementation of their `DrawPolygon (sides)` block (changing from a repeat loop to explicit turn commands for triangles/squares) and verify that all calls to `DrawPolygon` in other parts of the program still work without any changes to those calling scripts.

Description: Students test their custom blocks systematically with not just normal inputs, but also boundary values (e.g., 0, 1, maximum values) and edge cases (negative numbers, very large numbers, empty strings). They identify and fix bugs that only appear with certain inputs. For example, testing a "DrawPolygon (sides)" block with sides=3 (normal), sides=100 (large), sides=2 (invalid), sides=0 (invalid), and sides=-5 (invalid).

Assessment example: Students create a test plan for a custom block like `ClampValue (value) (min) (max)` and test it with: value within range, value equal to min, value equal to max, value below min, value above max, min > max, and all equal values, documenting expected and actual results.

Skill: Handle invalid inputs gracefully in custom blocks
Description: Students add defensive code to custom blocks to detect and handle invalid inputs appropriately. Instead of allowing blocks to crash or produce nonsense results with bad inputs, they add checks (using if blocks) and either: display an error message, use safe default values, or return a special "error" value. This introduces the concept of robust code that anticipates misuse.

Assessment example: Students modify their `DrawPolygon (sides)` block to check: if sides < 3, say "Error: need at least 3 sides" and stop the block. They test that the block now handles invalid inputs gracefully instead of attempting to draw an impossible shape.

Assessment example: Given a 25-block script that mixes game setup, player movement, collision checking, and scoring all in one long sequence, students refactor it into `SetupGame`, `MovePlayer`, `CheckCollisions`, and `UpdateScore` custom blocks, demonstrating that the refactored version is easier to understand and modify while producing identical behavior.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Add input validation to custom blocks
Description: Students add input validation to custom blocks to check that parameters meet requirements before executing the main logic. They use conditional blocks to verify parameter values are in valid ranges, are the right type, or meet other constraints. When validation fails, the block provides clear feedback. This is a more sophisticated version of error handling that validates inputs proactively.

Assessment example: In a `SetPlayerSpeed (speed)` block, students add validation: if speed < 0 or speed > 100, say "Speed must be between 0 and 100" and stop the block. Otherwise, set the speed variable. They test with valid and invalid inputs to verify the validation works.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.03: Test custom blocks with boundary and edge cases
* T11.G5.06: Define a custom block with two or more parameters

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Critique custom block naming and parameter choices
Description: Students evaluate custom block designs focusing specifically on naming conventions and parameter choices. They identify unclear or inconsistent names (e.g., "block1" vs "CalculateScore"), overly generic parameter names (e.g., "x" vs "playerScore"), missing parameters (forcing users to set variables before calling), or redundant parameters (values that could be calculated inside the block). They suggest concrete improvements to make blocks more understandable and reusable.

Assessment example: Given 5-6 custom block signatures like `DoStuff (x) (y)`, `Calculate (num)`, `MoveSprite (sprite) left (distance) by (amount)` (redundant parameters), students critique each and suggest improved names and parameter lists, explaining why the improvements matter.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.01.03: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation
* T11.G5.04: Choose between adding a parameter vs creating a separate block
* T11.G5.11: Create custom blocks with mixed text labels and parameters

ID: T11.G6.07
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Evaluate custom block scope and single responsibility
Description: Students evaluate whether custom blocks follow the "single responsibility principle"—each block should do ONE thing well. They identify blocks that try to do too much (e.g., a "SetupAndStartGame" block that does setup, plays music, shows instructions, AND starts the timer—four responsibilities) or too little (e.g., a block that just sets one variable—could be done without a custom block). They explain whether blocks should be split into smaller blocks or combined into larger ones, justifying their recommendations.

Assessment example: Students review 4-5 custom blocks and identify which ones violate single responsibility. For example, they identify that `SetupGameAndShowInstructions` should be split into two blocks: `SetupGame` (initializes variables and positions) and `ShowInstructions` (displays tutorial text), explaining how this improves clarity and reusability.

* T11.G6.01.03: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation

ID: T11.G6.08
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Evaluate custom block return value design
Description: Students evaluate whether custom blocks correctly use return values versus side effects (setting variables, moving sprites, changing state). They identify blocks that should return a value but instead set a global variable (reducing reusability), and blocks that return values when they should just perform actions. They explain the trade-offs between returning values (more flexible, easier to test) and modifying state (sometimes simpler for certain operations).

Assessment example: Given 5-6 custom block implementations, students identify design issues. For example: "CalculateScore" should return the score value instead of setting a global `score` variable (more flexible); "DrawShape" correctly performs an action without returning anything; "GetPlayerX" should return the x position instead of setting a `playerX` variable.

Dependencies:
* T11.G5.07: Decide whether a custom block should be a command or reporter
* T11.G5.08: Define a custom reporter block that returns a value

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Compare before and after code organization
Description: Students compare two versions of the same program: one written without custom blocks (all inline code) and one properly organized with custom blocks. They create a side-by-side comparison identifying specific improvements in the modular version: readability (easier to see structure), maintainability (changes are localized), reusability (blocks called multiple times), and testability (blocks can be tested individually). This develops critical thinking about when and why to use custom blocks.

Assessment example: Given two implementations of the same game (one 50-block monolithic script, one organized into 6 custom blocks), students write a comparison report identifying 4-5 specific ways the modular version is better, with concrete examples from the code.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.04: Refactor spaghetti code into organized custom blocks

ID: T11.G7.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Implement algorithms as reusable custom blocks
Description: Students implement ONE specific algorithm (e.g., linear search through a list, finding the maximum value in a list, computing greatest common divisor, or binary search) as a custom block with clear parameters and return values. They demonstrate that the complex algorithm is encapsulated in a reusable block that hides implementation details—users can call the block without understanding how the algorithm works internally. They test the block with multiple different inputs to verify correctness and reusability.

Assessment example: Students create a `FindMaxInList (listName)` custom reporter block that uses a loop and comparison logic to find the largest value in any list. They test it with different lists (numbers, scores, ages) to demonstrate it works with any list of numbers.

Dependencies:
* T11.G6.01.03: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation
* T11.G5.08: Define a custom reporter block that returns a value

Skill: Plan a coordinated set of 3-5 custom blocks for one feature
Description: Students design (on paper or as documentation, not code yet) exactly 3-5 related custom blocks that will work together to implement ONE specific game feature or subsystem. They specify each block's interface (name, parameters, return value), describe what it does, and explain how the blocks interact (which blocks call which others). This planning skill ensures thoughtful design before implementation.

Assessment example: Students create a design document for a "Health System" with blocks: `TakeDamage (amount)`, `Heal (amount)`, `IsAlive returns: true/false`, `ShowHealthBar`, explaining that TakeDamage and Heal modify the health variable and call ShowHealthBar, while IsAlive checks if health > 0.

Skill: Implement a coordinated set of custom blocks for one feature
Description: Students implement the custom block set they planned in T11.G7.02.01, creating exactly 3-5 related blocks that work together. They test each block individually and then test the feature as a whole. They demonstrate that the blocks have consistent naming patterns, complementary parameters, and clear division of responsibilities. They show the complete feature working correctly in a demonstration project.

Assessment example: Students implement their planned "Inventory System" with blocks `AddItem (item)`, `RemoveItem (item)`, `HasItem (item) returns: true/false`, `ShowInventory`, and `ClearInventory`. They demonstrate these blocks working together in a simple collection game where players pick up items, check their inventory, and use items.

Skill: Document a coordinated custom block set
Description: Students create comprehensive documentation for their coordinated block set, including: an overview of what the feature does, a list of all blocks with their interfaces, usage examples showing how to call each block, and notes on how the blocks work together. This documentation helps others use the feature without reading the implementation code, demonstrating that well-documented abstractions enable knowledge sharing and code reuse.

Assessment example: Students write documentation for their "Score System" blocks that includes: purpose ("manages player score with combo multipliers"), block list (`AddPoints (points)`, `ApplyMultiplier (multiplier)`, `ResetCombo`, `GetScore returns: current score`), example usage showing a typical scoring sequence, and notes explaining that ResetCombo should be called when the player makes a mistake.

ID: T11.G7.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand encapsulation and information hiding
Description: Students understand the principle of encapsulation: a well-designed custom block acts like a "black box" where users only need to know WHAT it does (its interface: name, parameters, return value) and not HOW it does it (the implementation inside). They compare examples of blocks with clean, self-contained interfaces versus blocks that require users to know internal details (like specific variable names used inside). They explain how "information hiding" makes code easier to use, understand, and modify, because changes to internal implementation won't break code that calls the block as long as the interface stays the same.

Assessment example: Students compare two implementations of a score system: (A) custom blocks with clear interfaces that hide internal score tracking in local variables, vs (B) blocks that require callers to directly manipulate global score variables. They explain why version A is better: users don't need to know how score is stored internally, and the implementation can be changed without breaking calling code.

Dependencies:
* T11.G7.01: Implement algorithms as reusable custom blocks
* T11.G6.01.03: Design complete custom block interfaces before implementation
* T11.G6.08: Evaluate custom block return value design

ID: T11.G7.04
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Trace and debug multi-level custom block calls
Description: Students trace through the execution of a script where custom blocks call other custom blocks (2-3 levels deep). They predict outputs, track variable values through multiple call levels, and identify bugs in the call hierarchy. This reinforces understanding of the call stack: when block A calls block B calls block C, execution goes into C, returns to B, returns to A. They practice debugging errors that only appear when blocks are called in certain combinations.

Assessment example: Given a game script where `UpdateGame` calls `MovePlayer` which calls `CheckBoundary`, and there's a bug in CheckBoundary's logic, students trace through the full execution path to find where the bug occurs, tracking position values through all three block levels.

Dependencies:
* T11.G7.02.02: Implement a coordinated set of custom blocks for one feature
* T11.G5.09: Debug a script with incorrect custom block calls
* T11.G6.05: Add input validation to custom blocks

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand when custom blocks call each other (helper blocks)
Description: Students learn that custom blocks can call other custom blocks, and identify "helper blocks" that are primarily called by other custom blocks rather than from main scripts. They understand that breaking complex blocks into smaller helper blocks improves organization and enables reuse at multiple levels. They design block structures where main blocks handle coordination and call helper blocks for specific subtasks.

Assessment example: Students create a `DrawComplexShape` block that calls helper blocks `DrawPolygon (sides)` and `MoveToNextPosition (x) (y)`. They explain that the helper blocks are reusable pieces that DrawComplexShape orchestrates to accomplish its goal.

* T11.G7.02.02: Implement a coordinated set of custom blocks for one feature

ID: T11.G8.01
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Design general-purpose custom blocks with reusable interfaces
Description: Students design 3-5 custom blocks specifically for reuse across different projects or contexts. Unlike project-specific blocks, these have general-purpose interfaces that don't depend on specific sprite names, variable names, or game logic. For example, `CheckCollision (sprite1) (sprite2)` works with ANY sprites, not just "player" and "enemy". Students identify what makes a block general-purpose (parameterizing everything that varies, avoiding hard-coded values, using clear generic names) versus project-specific, and explain the benefits and limitations of general-purpose design.

Assessment example: Students create general-purpose utility blocks like `CheckOverlap (sprite1) (sprite2) returns: true/false`, `ClampValue (value) (min) (max) returns: clamped value`, and `WrapPosition (x) (y) (minX) (maxX) (minY) (maxY)` that could be used in any game project. They explain what makes these reusable (parameterized, no hard-coded game-specific values) versus a block like `CheckPlayerEnemyCollision` which is game-specific.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Demonstrate custom block reuse across multiple contexts
Description: Students create a small library of 3-4 general-purpose custom blocks and demonstrate their reusability by using EACH block in at least TWO different contexts within a project or across two small projects. For example, a `CheckOverlap (sprite1) (sprite2)` block might be used for both player-enemy collision AND player-collectible collision. They document how the same block interface serves multiple purposes without modification, demonstrating that good abstraction enables code reuse.

Assessment example: Students create utility blocks for games (e.g., `RandomPosition (minX) (maxX) (minY) (maxY)`, `WrapAround (sprite) (minX) (maxX) (minY) (maxY)`, `ClampValue (value) (min) (max) returns: value`) and use each block in multiple different game mechanics (enemy spawning, player wrapping, collectible placement, health clamping, speed limiting), showing that good abstraction reduces code duplication across the project.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Refactor a large program into a hierarchical block structure
Description: Students take a large, unorganized program (30+ blocks) and reorganize it using a thoughtful hierarchy of custom blocks: top-level blocks that coordinate major features, mid-level blocks that implement specific features by calling helper blocks, and low-level utility blocks that handle common operations. They create a diagram showing the hierarchy (which blocks call which others) and document how the structure improves clarity and maintainability. They demonstrate that changes to low-level blocks propagate correctly through the hierarchy.

Assessment example: Students refactor a 40-block game into a hierarchy: main script calls `SetupGame`, `RunGameLoop`, `ShowGameOver`; RunGameLoop calls `ProcessInput`, `UpdateGame`, `RenderFrame`; UpdateGame calls `MovePlayer`, `UpdateEnemies`, `CheckCollisions`; and several utility blocks like `ClampPosition` and `CheckOverlap` are called by multiple blocks. They create a call diagram showing this structure.

Skill: Create custom blocks that work with lists and complex data
Description: Students create custom blocks that accept and return lists or structured data, enabling powerful abstractions for managing collections. They implement blocks like `FilterList (listName) (condition) returns: filtered list`, `FindInList (listName) (value) returns: index or -1`, or blocks that manage game entities stored as lists of structured data. These blocks demonstrate that custom blocks can handle complex data types, not just simple numbers and strings.

Assessment example: Students create an inventory system using list-based custom blocks: `AddItemToInventory (itemList) (itemName) (quantity)`, `RemoveItemFromInventory (itemList) (itemName) (quantity) returns: success`, `FindItem (itemList) (itemName) returns: index`, showing how blocks can encapsulate complex list operations.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Analyze trade-offs between modular and inline code
Description: Students examine two versions of a program: one organized into many custom blocks, one written mostly inline. They discuss trade-offs in readability (blocks add abstraction but also indirection), maintainability (blocks make changes easier but add complexity), code reuse (blocks enable reuse but require good design), and cognitive load (blocks can simplify OR complicate depending on design quality). They develop critical thinking about when and how much to modularize, understanding that over-modularization (too many tiny blocks) can be as problematic as under-modularization (huge monolithic scripts).

Assessment example: Students compare three versions of the same program: (A) all inline (50 blocks), (B) reasonably modular (6-8 custom blocks), (C) overly modular (20+ tiny custom blocks). They write an analysis explaining why version B is often best, but identifying scenarios where A or C might be preferable.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Create a reusable block library across projects
Description: Students create a collection of 5-8 general-purpose custom blocks designed to be copied and reused across multiple different projects. They organize these blocks into a "library" project that serves as a starting point or reference. The blocks cover common needs like collision detection, mathematical utilities, drawing helpers, or input handling. Students document each block's interface and usage, and demonstrate copying blocks from the library into 2-3 different new projects where they're immediately useful without modification.

Assessment example: Students create a "Game Utilities Library" with blocks like `CheckCollision (sprite1) (sprite2)`, `ClampValue (val) (min) (max)`, `RandomRange (min) (max)`, `WrapAround (sprite)`, `DistanceBetween (x1) (y1) (x2) (y2)`. They demonstrate copying these blocks into different game projects (platformer, shooter, puzzle game) where they work without changes.

Skill: Refactor redundant custom blocks into general versions
Description: Students examine a project with multiple similar custom blocks that have slight variations (e.g., `CheckPlayerEnemyCollision`, `CheckPlayerCoinCollision`, `CheckEnemyWallCollision`) and refactor them into one general-purpose block with appropriate parameters (e.g., `CheckCollision (sprite1) (sprite2)`). They replace all calls to the specific blocks with calls to the general block, testing that behavior remains the same. This teaches the skill of recognizing patterns in code and extracting generalizations that reduce duplication while maintaining functionality.

Assessment example: Students find a project with separate blocks for `DrawRedSquare (size)`, `DrawBlueSquare (size)`, `DrawGreenSquare (size)` and refactor into one `DrawSquare (size) (color)` block, updating all callers and verifying the program still works correctly.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Recognize when a CreatiCode script has errors
Description: Students learn to identify common error indicators in CreatiCode at the introductory level: (1) blocks that turn red or orange when clicked (indicating an error in that block), (2) scripts that don't run when the green flag is clicked (nothing happens), (3) sprites that freeze or stop responding during execution. They practice spotting these visual cues and understanding that they signal something needs to be fixed. This is a foundational recognition skill - learning WHAT signals appear - preparing them for later systematic interpretation of errors.

Dependencies:

ID: T13.G3.01
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Test and trace simple block-based scripts
Description: Students perform two key debugging skills: (1) TRACE - Look at a simple 3-5 block script without running it and predict what each block will do in sequence (sprite's final position, appearance, or speech), then (2) TEST - Run the script in CreatiCode, observe the actual behavior, and compare it to their prediction. If behavior doesn't match expectation (e.g., "should move 50 steps right, then say Hello"), they identify which specific block produced unexpected results by checking one block at a time. This combines mental tracing with actual testing.

ID: T13.G3.04
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Practice the debugging cycle: run, observe, change, test again
Description: Students practice the iterative debugging cycle: (1) run the program, (2) observe what went wrong (sprite moves wrong direction, says wrong message, etc.), (3) make ONE specific change to a block (change a number, swap a block, reorder blocks), and (4) test again. They repeat this cycle 2-3 times, experiencing iteration as normal rather than expecting perfection on first try. This teaches that debugging is a process, not a single action.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Identify and explain which block causes unexpected behavior
Description: Students run a script that produces wrong output and identify which specific block is causing the problem by mentally stepping through the code and comparing expected behavior to actual behavior at each step. They not only point to the problematic block but also explain WHY it's wrong (e.g., "This says 'turn right 90' but it should be 'turn left 90' to face the target"). This skill builds on T13.G3.01 by requiring explanation of the error, not just identification.

Skill: Identify sequence errors (blocks in wrong order)
Description: Students examine broken programs and identify sequence errors where blocks are in the wrong order (e.g., "say Hello" happens before "move to position," or sprite changes costume after it should have been visible). Given 2-3 programs with sequence bugs, they identify which blocks need to be reordered and explain why the current sequence produces wrong behavior.

Skill: Identify missing block errors
Description: Students examine broken programs and identify where necessary blocks are missing (e.g., forgot "point in direction" before moving, missing "set variable to 0" initialization, no "stop all" at game end). Given 2-3 programs with missing blocks, they identify what's missing, where it should go, and explain what symptom the missing block causes.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Use debug print blocks to trace program execution
Description: Students add `print [message] in [console v]` or `print [message] in [alert v]` blocks at key points in their program to see which parts of code are running and in what order. They use simple messages like "loop started", "reached this point", or print variable values like "score is now [score]" to understand program flow. After finding the bug, they remove the debug blocks. This introduces systematic tracing using CreatiCode's built-in debug features.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Use say blocks to display execution progress
Description: Students add `say [message]` blocks at key points in their program to show which part of code is currently executing. They use simple messages like "loop started", "reached checkpoint 1", "entering if-block" to trace program flow. This helps identify which sections of code are running and in what order, making it easier to locate where behavior diverges from expectations.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Use say blocks to display variable values
Description: Students add `say [variable]` blocks inside loops and conditionals to display current variable values during execution. This allows them to see how variables change over time and identify when values are incorrect (e.g., "say score" shows score is stuck at 0 instead of increasing). This technique is especially useful for debugging calculations and variable updates.

ID: T13.G5.01.03
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Use variable monitors to track multiple values
Description: Students check the monitor boxes for multiple variables to display them simultaneously on stage while the program runs. They observe how multiple values change in real-time during execution, making it easier to spot relationships between variables or identify which variable has an incorrect value. This method is less intrusive than say blocks since it doesn't pause or slow down program execution.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Systematically trace execution flow with multiple methods
Description: Students combine multiple debugging techniques to systematically trace complex bugs: (1) use say blocks for execution flow, (2) use say blocks for critical variable values, (3) enable variable monitors for real-time tracking, and (4) use debug print blocks for console output. They systematically add debug output at each major section (before loop, inside loop, after conditional) to narrow down where the bug occurs. This represents mastery of advanced debugging techniques.

ID: T13.G5.02
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Add input validation to handle invalid entries
Description: Students design a program that accepts user input and add conditional checks to reject or handle invalid entries gracefully (e.g., if a player enters a negative number when a positive is required, the program asks again or defaults safely). This builds on edge case awareness by actively preventing problems.

Dependencies:
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T13.G4.02: Identify and manually test edge cases

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Create and follow a comprehensive test plan with multiple input types
Description: Students design a comprehensive test plan covering three categories of inputs: (1) normal/typical cases (expected use), (2) boundary cases (minimum, maximum, zero, edge of screen), and (3) invalid inputs (negative when positive expected, empty values). They create 8-10 test cases total across all three categories, run each systematically, record pass/fail results, and summarize which categories had the most failures.

ID: T13.G5.04.01
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Add condition checks before risky operations
Description: Students identify risky operations in their program (accessing list items, division, sprite positioning) and add defensive if-checks before executing them. For example: check "if list length > 0" before accessing item 1, check "if divisor ≠ 0" before dividing, check "if x < 240" before moving right. They test that these checks prevent crashes or unexpected behavior in edge cases.

Dependencies:
* T13.G4.02: Identify and manually test edge cases
* T13.G5.02: Add input validation to handle invalid entries
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence

ID: T13.G5.04.02
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Handle boundary values gracefully
Description: Students add special handling for boundary conditions in their programs: when score reaches exactly 0, when sprite reaches stage edges (x=±240, y=±180), when lists become empty, or when timers hit 0. They use conditionals to handle these cases explicitly (e.g., "if score < 0 then set score to 0" or "if x > 240 then set x to 240") rather than allowing undefined behavior. They test boundary cases to verify graceful handling.

Dependencies:
* T13.G4.02: Identify and manually test edge cases
* T13.G5.04.01: Add condition checks before risky operations
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop

ID: T13.G5.04.03
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Document defensive improvements made
Description: Students create documentation describing the defensive improvements they made to a program. For each improvement, they explain: (1) what was fragile or could fail, (2) what defensive check or handling they added, and (3) what test case now passes that previously would have failed. This combines defensive programming with documentation skills, teaching students to explain their robustness improvements.

Dependencies:
* T13.G5.04.01: Add condition checks before risky operations
* T13.G5.04.02: Handle boundary values gracefully

ID: T13.G5.05
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Debug complex two-level nested structures
Description: Students debug a program with complex two-level nesting: loops inside loops, conditionals with if-else branches inside loops, or multiple conditionals in sequence within a loop. They systematically identify which level (outer loop, inner structure, or specific condition) has the bug and fix it. This builds on simpler single-conditional-in-loop debugging from G4.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Debug deeply nested structures (three+ levels)
Description: Students debug a program with three or more levels of nesting (e.g., a loop inside a loop with a conditional inside that, or nested conditionals inside nested loops). They trace through multiple levels systematically to identify which level is causing incorrect behavior and fix it. This is more complex than two-level nesting.

Dependencies:
* T07.G3.01
* T08.G3.01

ID: T13.G5.07
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Read and interpret error indicators systematically
Description: Students systematically interpret error indicators in CreatiCode to diagnose problems: they examine blocks that turn red/orange (identifying which parameter or operation is invalid), analyze sprites that freeze (checking for infinite loops or missing wait blocks), and investigate scripts that don't run (verifying trigger blocks and dependencies). They connect each type of error indicator to specific categories of bugs and use this information to form debugging hypotheses. This advances beyond G3.00's basic recognition by teaching systematic interpretation of error signals.

Dependencies:

ID: T13.G5.08
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Debug a program with limited changes allowed
Description: Students are given a broken program with a constraint: "Fix the bug by changing only numbers/values in blocks" or "Fix by reordering blocks, not adding or removing any." This develops precision in identifying exactly what's wrong and forces systematic thinking (can't just try random additions). They must identify the minimal change needed.

ID: T13.G5.09
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Use breakpoint blocks to stop execution at specific points
Description: Students insert `breakpoint` blocks at strategic locations in their program, then run it using the blue arrow (Debug Mode) instead of the green flag. When execution pauses at a breakpoint, they examine sprite positions, variable values (using monitors), and stage state to understand exactly what's happening at that moment. They step through the program section by section, moving the breakpoint block to different locations to isolate problems. This allows precise inspection of program state and is especially useful for debugging timing issues and complex loops.

Skill: Interpret console output and error messages
Description: Students learn to read and understand messages that appear in the CreatiCode console window, including: (1) debug print output showing program flow and variable values, (2) error messages indicating what went wrong (e.g., "list index out of range", "undefined variable", "invalid operation"), (3) warning messages about potential problems. They practice connecting console messages to specific blocks or code sections, using the information to locate and fix bugs. This skill bridges visual debugging and text-based error interpretation, preparing students for text-based programming environments.

ID: T13.G6.02
Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Use a systematic debugging process (hypothesis-driven)
Description: Students apply a 4-step debugging method: (1) observe and describe the symptom (what goes wrong and when), (2) form a hypothesis about which block or logic causes it (e.g., "I think the repeat count is too low"), (3) test the hypothesis by adding `say` blocks to check that value or temporarily changing the block, and (4) verify the fix by running all previous test cases. They document this process for 2-3 bugs, distinguishing it from random trial-and-error.

Skill: Design systematic boundary tests using a matrix
Description: Students design a systematic boundary test matrix for a program with numeric inputs. For each input variable, they identify 5 test values: (1) minimum valid, (2) just below minimum (invalid), (3) typical middle value, (4) maximum valid, (5) just above maximum (invalid). They create a test matrix documenting expected vs. actual results for each value, ensuring comprehensive coverage of edge conditions and invalid inputs.

Skill: Debug a peer's program using systematic observation
Description: Students are given a classmate's broken program (without seeing the fix). They use systematic observation: (1) run the program and observe symptoms, (2) add `say` blocks or monitors to trace variable values, (3) form a hypothesis about the bug, (4) discuss their hypothesis with the author (without immediately revealing it), and (5) help guide the author to discover the fix themselves. This introduces collaborative debugging and explaining bugs to others.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Simplify complex code to make it easier to understand and test
Description: Students identify a complex section of code (long script with 20+ blocks, deep nesting, or repeated blocks) and simplify it using at least two techniques: (1) break large scripts into smaller custom blocks with clear names, (2) replace repeated code blocks with a loop or custom block, (3) rename variables to be more descriptive (e.g., "playerScore" instead of "s"), or (4) add comment blocks to explain what each section does. They verify the refactored version produces identical results using test cases from earlier work. This makes code easier to debug and maintain.

Topic: T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
Skill: Anticipate runtime errors and add defensive checks
Description: Students identify 3-5 operations in their program that could fail at runtime: (1) division (check if divisor ≠ 0 before dividing), (2) list access (check if list length > index before accessing), (3) user input (check if answer is a valid number before using), (4) position boundaries (check if x/y within stage bounds), or (5) countdown timers (check if timer > 0 before decrementing).

Skill: Evaluate code correctness, edge case coverage, and assumptions
Description: Students critically review code (their own or AI-generated) using a 4-question framework: (1) Does it correctly solve the stated problem for all normal inputs? (2) What edge cases does it miss (empty data, zero values, maximum limits, negative numbers)? (3) What assumptions does it make (e.g., "assumes user always enters a number," "assumes list always has items")? (4) What are potential failure modes (where could it crash or give wrong results)? They write a review document answering all four questions with specific examples, then propose 2-3 improvements to make the code more robust.

Skill: Smooth movement with glide
Description: Use `glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (50)` to smoothly animate a sprite moving to a position over time, creating visible motion. Unlike `go to x: y:` which teleports instantly, glide creates a smooth animation from the current position to the target position. The duration parameter controls animation speed: longer durations (2-3 seconds) create slow, dramatic movement; shorter durations (0.5 seconds) create quick, snappy actions. Use glide for character walking, flying, or sliding animations. Combine multiple glide blocks in sequence to create path-following: `glide (1) secs to x: (0) y: (0)` then `glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (100)` creates an L-shaped path.

Skill: Update label text for dynamic displays
Description: Change label text while your project runs using `set value to [New Text] for widget [title v]`. This replaces all existing text in the label. Use this to update story titles when scenes change, display character names when speakers change, or show status messages. Combine with variables to show dynamic information: `set value to (join [Score: ] (score)) for widget [scoreLabel v]`. Update labels in response to events: `when I receive [NewScene]` → `set value to [Chapter 2] for widget [title v]`. Labels update instantly when you change their value.

Skill: Print temporary text at positions
Description: Use `print [text] at x (0) y (0) width (300) height (100) color [#2CADE5FF]` to display TEMPORARY text directly on the stage at specific coordinates. Unlike labels (which are widgets), printed text is drawn as a layer on the stage and stays until cleared or the project stops. Printed text appears BELOW sprites and widgets in the layer order. The text wraps within the specified width and height. Use color parameter for text color (hex format #RRGGBBAA). Printed text is useful for annotations, floating labels, or temporary messages that should not be clickable UI elements.

Skill: Create timed and sprite-relative text
Description: Use `print [text] at x (0) y (0) width (300) height (100) color [#2CADE5FF] for (2) seconds` to automatically hide text after a duration. This is useful for temporary notifications, damage numbers, or status effects. Create floating text near sprites by using sprite position variables: `print [Ouch!] at x (my x) y ((my y) + (50)) width (100) height (30) color [#FF0000FF] for (1) seconds` displays red text 50 pixels above the sprite for 1 second. The text stays at the printed position even if the sprite moves afterward (it is not attached to the sprite). Display multiple simultaneous texts at different positions for conversations or multiple events happening at once.

Skill: Clear printed text for scene changes
Description: Use `clear all my prints` to remove all printed text created by this sprite. This clears both timed and permanent printed text. Use this when scenes change to remove old text: `when I receive [NewScene]` → `clear all my prints`. Note that `clear all my prints` only removes text printed by the current sprite. If multiple sprites print text, each sprite must clear its own prints, or you can use a scene manager sprite that broadcasts a 'ClearAll' message that all sprites respond to by clearing their prints. Printed text is NOT automatically cleared when you hide a sprite - you must explicitly clear it.

Skill: Use broadcasts to trigger scene changes
Description: Use `broadcast [Scene2]` to send scene change messages and `when I receive [Scene2]` to respond to them. Broadcasting is how you coordinate multiple sprites to create the illusion of changing locations or scenes. When you `broadcast [Scene2]`, ALL sprites with `when I receive [Scene2]` hat blocks will run their scripts simultaneously. This allows you to trigger many changes at once: some sprites show, some hide, some move, some change appearance. Each sprite decides how to respond to each scene. For example, Scene1 might show characters in a house, Scene2 might show them in a forest - different sprites respond by showing/hiding/moving to create each scene.

Skill: Program sprite responses to scene broadcasts
Description: In each sprite, add `when I receive [SceneName]` scripts that control how the sprite behaves in that scene. Use `show` to make the sprite visible in this scene, `hide` to make it invisible. Use `go to x: () y: ()` to position the sprite correctly for this scene. For example, a House sprite: `when I receive [Scene1]` → `show` + `go to x: (0) y: (-50)` (appears in Scene1), `when I receive [Scene2]` → `hide` (disappears in Scene2). A Character sprite might move between scenes: `when I receive [Scene1]` → `go to x: (-100) y: (0)` + `show`, `when I receive [Scene2]` → `go to x: (50) y: (0)` + `show`. Every sprite needs receive blocks for every scene where it appears or needs to do something.

Skill: Change stage backdrop for scenes
Description: Use `switch backdrop to [backdrop2 v]` to change the stage background image to a specific backdrop, or `next backdrop` to cycle through backdrops. Backdrops set the visual scene for your story. Combine with broadcast events for scene changes: in the Stage scripts, add `when I receive [Scene2]` then `switch backdrop to [Forest v]`. The stage is a special sprite that can have multiple backdrops (like costumes for sprites). Add backdrops by clicking the Stage, then the "Backdrops" tab.

Description: Use `set [ghost v] effect to (50)` to set an effect value, or `change [ghost v] effect by (10)` to gradually modify it. Ghost effect (0-100) creates transparency - use for fade-in/fade-out transitions, ghost characters, or dream sequences. Brightness effect (-100 to 100) creates dark/light moods for night/day scenes. Color effect shifts hues for magical transformations. Use `clear graphic effects` to reset all effects to normal.

Skill: Coordinate scene changes with broadcasts
Description: Synchronize scene transitions across MULTIPLE sprites using broadcasts. When `broadcast [Scene2]` is sent, ALL sprites with `when I receive [Scene2]` respond simultaneously. The challenge at this level is ensuring smooth coordination: sprites should show/hide together, positions should match the new scene, and no sprite should be left in an incorrect state. Create a checklist for each scene: which sprites show, which hide, where each one positions. Test transitions from every possible scene to catch coordination bugs. Use `broadcast [SceneX] and wait` if you need the current script to pause until all sprite responses complete.

Skill: Sequential actions with broadcast and wait
Description: Use `broadcast [Action1] and wait` to pause the current script until ALL scripts triggered by that broadcast complete their actions. This ensures animations happen in strict sequence: Character A finishes walking completely BEFORE Character B starts talking. Compare to regular `broadcast [Action1]` (without "and wait") which continues immediately, allowing parallel/simultaneous actions. Example: `broadcast [WalkToCenter] and wait` → Character moves (takes 3 seconds) → Current script pauses for those 3 seconds → `say [I made it!]` only runs after movement completes. Use "broadcast and wait" for cutscenes where timing order matters, regular "broadcast" when actions should happen at the same time.

Skill: Layering sprites and text
Description: Understand the layer order in CreatiCode projects: Background (stage backdrop - furthest back) → Printed text (`print` blocks) → Sprites (ordered front-to-back by layer number) → Widgets (labels, buttons - always on top). When sprites overlap, the one with a higher layer number appears in front. Knowing this order helps you plan visual compositions: backgrounds should use backdrops, floating text uses print blocks, interactive characters use sprites, and UI elements like buttons use widgets. You cannot make sprites appear above widgets or printed text appear above sprites.

Description: Use `draw rectangle at x (0) y (0) width (200) height (100) fill [#6269F8FF] border [#20B755FF] width (1) corner radius (0) rotation (0)` to programmatically draw rectangles on the sprite's current vector costume when your code runs. Unlike the paint editor (manual design tool), this block draws shapes dynamically as scripts execute. The rectangle is positioned at (x, y) coordinates relative to the costume center. Fill color is the inside color, border color is the outline color, border width is outline thickness in pixels. Corner radius creates rounded corners (0 = sharp, 10+ = rounded). Rotation rotates the rectangle clockwise by degrees. The rectangle is drawn ON the costume (not on the stage), so it moves with the sprite.

When width equals height, you get a perfect circle. When width differs from height, you get an oval/ellipse. The position (x, y) is the center of the oval. Fill and border colors work the same as rectangles. Rotation rotates the oval clockwise by degrees (useful for tilted ovals). Combine rectangle and oval drawing in loops to create patterns: `repeat (10)` → `draw oval...` → `change x by (20)` creates a row of circles.

Create health bars that change size: `draw rectangle at x (-100) y (150) width ((health) * (2)) height (20) fill [#00FF00FF]...` where health variable (0-100) controls bar length. Create status icons that appear/disappear: `if <(hasShield) = [true]>` → `draw oval at x (50) y (50) width (30) height (30) fill [#0000FFFF]...` for a shield indicator. Generate patterns in loops: `repeat (10)` with `draw rectangle at x ((i) * (30))...` creates evenly spaced rectangles. Use rotation in loops to create radial patterns: `repeat (12)` with `draw rectangle... rotation ((i) * (30))` creates a starburst.

Skill: Draw straight lines on vector costumes
Description: Use `draw line in [#386AF8FF] from x (0) y (0) to x (100) y (100) thickness (2)` to draw straight lines on vector costumes. The line goes from point (from x, from y) to point (to x, to y). Color is specified in hex format. Thickness is line width in pixels (1 = thin, 5+ = thick). Lines are useful for connecting objects, creating borders, drawing diagrams, or making custom shapes by combining multiple lines. Draw a square with 4 lines: line from (0,0) to (100,0), from (100,0) to (100,100), from (100,100) to (0,100), from (0,100) to (0,0). Draw a triangle with 3 lines connecting 3 points.

The curve starts at (from x, from y) and ends at (to x, to y). Control points 1 and 2 shape the curve's bend - they act like invisible magnets pulling the curve toward them. To create a simple arc, place both control points above or below the line between start and end points. For S-curves, place control points on opposite sides. Experiment with control point positions to see how they affect curve shape. Curves are useful for smooth paths, decorative flourishes, or organic shapes.

Description: Use `draw text [Hello] at x (0) y (0) size (24) color [#000000FF] rotation (0)` to draw text directly on vector costumes. Unlike `print` blocks (which display text on the stage layer), this draws text AS PART OF the costume itself. The text becomes permanent part of the costume until cleared. Position (x, y) is the text anchor point. Size is font size in pixels. Color is text color in hex format. Rotation tilts the text clockwise by degrees. Use for labeling costume elements, adding titles to procedurally generated images, or creating text-based visual effects. Draw text in loops to create repeating labels or artistic text patterns.

Skill: Clear all costume drawings
Description: Use `clear all drawings` to remove ALL programmatic drawings (rectangles, ovals, lines, curves, text) from this sprite's current costume. This block only clears elements drawn with drawing blocks - it does NOT erase shapes manually created in the paint editor. Those paint editor shapes are permanent parts of the costume. Use `clear all drawings` at the start of scripts with `when green flag clicked` to reset costumes to their original state, or use with scene changes `when I receive [NewScene]` to clear old visual elements before drawing new ones.

Description: Choose from 30+ languages including English (United States), English (United Kingdom), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), French (France), Chinese (Mandarin, China), Japanese (Japan), German (Germany), Italian (Italy), Portuguese (Brazil), Russian (Russia), Korean (Korea), and many more. Each language has multiple voice types: Female, Male, Female2, Male2, Female3, Male3, Boy, and Girl. Not all voice types work in all languages - experiment to find available voices. Use different voices for different characters to create distinct personalities: Female for a princess, Male for a knight, Boy/Girl for children characters. Language selection allows creating bilingual or multilingual stories.

Skill: Adjust speech characteristics for expression
Description: Modify speed, pitch, and volume to create expressive speech. Speed (50-200): 50 is half speed (slow, careful), 100 is normal, 150 is fast (excited), 200 is very fast (rushed). Pitch (50-200): 50 is low pitch (deep voice, serious), 100 is normal, 150 is high pitch (cheerful, excited), 200 is very high (childlike, squeaky). Volume (0-200): 0 is silent, 50 is quiet (whisper), 100 is normal, 150 is loud, 200 is very loud (shouting). Combine adjustments for character personality: speed=80, pitch=70, volume=100 for a wise old character; speed=120, pitch=140, volume=110 for an energetic child. Test values to find the right expression for each character or mood.

Topic: T15 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Calculate animation timing
Description: Synchronize animations by matching `wait` block durations to speech and motion. If a character says text for 3 seconds (`say [Hello there!] for (3) seconds`), other sprites should `wait (3) seconds` before responding. For text-to-speech, estimate timing: approximately 2-3 seconds per 10 words at normal speed (100). Adjust for speed changes: 50% speed takes twice as long, 200% speed takes half as long. For glide animations, the duration IS the time: `glide (2) secs to x: y:` takes exactly 2 seconds. Coordinate multi-sprite scenes: Sprite A: `say [text] for (3) secs` + `glide (2) secs to x:y:`, Sprite B: `wait (5) secs` (3+2) then respond. Test your timings and adjust wait blocks if characters overlap or pause too long.

Topic: T15 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Cutscene controller with custom blocks
Description: Create a custom block called "Cutscene" (using "Make a Block") that orchestrates multi-step story sequences using `broadcast and wait` to ensure strict timing. Inside the custom block: `broadcast [Step1] and wait`, `broadcast [Step2] and wait`, `broadcast [Step3] and wait`. Each broadcast triggers a different character's action (walking, talking, reacting) and the "and wait" ensures the previous action finishes before the next begins. Call the custom block with `Cutscene` under `when green flag clicked`. This centralizes complex animation sequences in one reusable block, making stories easier to debug and modify. Use for intro sequences, dramatic reveals, or multi-character conversations.

Skill: Multi-language text-to-speech storytelling
Description: Create stories that speak in multiple languages by combining text-to-speech with conditionals. Store the player's language preference in a variable: `set [playerLanguage v] to [Spanish]`. Use `if <(playerLanguage) = [Spanish]> then say [Hola!] in [Spanish (Spain) v] as [Female v]` blocks to speak different dialogue based on the selected language. Store parallel dialogue in lists: `[dialogueEnglish v]` and `[dialogueSpanish v]`, then use the appropriate list based on `(playerLanguage)`. Adjust speed (50-150) for slower/faster speech to help language learners, or change pitch (80-120) to create character variety within the same language.

Skill: Basic speech recognition input
Description: Use speech recognition blocks to accept voice input from players. Start listening with `start recognizing speech in [English (United States) v] record as [input1]` (uses Microsoft Azure API) or `OpenAI: start recognizing speech in [English (United States) v] record as [input1]` (uses Whisper API). When ready to process the speech, use `end speech recognition` which stops recording and sends the audio to the AI service for text conversion. Read the recognized text with the reporter block `(text from speech)`. Save it to a variable: `set [playerInput v] to (text from speech)`, then respond: `say (join [You said: ] (playerInput))`. This allows hands-free story interaction.

Topic: T15 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Voice-controlled story choices
Description: Combine speech recognition with conditional logic to trigger story events based on spoken keywords. After using `start recognizing speech` and `end speech recognition`, check the result: `if <(text from speech) contains [yes]> then broadcast [AcceptQuest]` or `if <(text from speech) contains [no]> then broadcast [RejectQuest]`. Use `contains` instead of `=` because speech recognition may include extra words ("yes please" should match "yes"). Check for multiple keywords to handle variations: `if <or <(text from speech) contains [yes]> <(text from speech) contains [yeah]>>`. This allows players to speak choices like "Go left", "Attack the dragon", or "Yes" instead of clicking buttons, creating more immersive voice-driven stories.

Description: Use `add rich textbox at X (0) Y (0) width (400) height (300) padding (10) mode [read only v] as [storyText]` to create formatted text displays that support bold, italics, colors, and multiple paragraphs. Rich textboxes accept HTML-like formatting in the text value. Set formatted text with `set value to [<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Once upon a time...] for widget [storyText v]`. Use `<b>text</b>` for bold, `<i>text</i>` for italics, `<br>` for line breaks, `<font color='red'>text</font>` for colored text. Create book-like story presentations with styled text, chapter headings, and formatted dialogue. Set mode to [read only] so players can't edit the text, or [input] to let them write their own stories.

Skill: Visual stat tracking with sliders
Description: Use `add slider at X (0) Y (0) width (200) min (0) max (100) as [healthBar]` to create visual stat displays for story variables. After creating the slider widget, link it to a variable by updating the slider whenever the variable changes: `when [health v] changes` → `set value to (health) for widget [healthBar v]`. Position sliders at screen edges to show stats like health (red slider at top right), mood (yellow slider at top left), or relationship levels (green sliders at bottom). Use widget styling to color-code stats: `set widget background color [#FF0000FF]...` for health (red), `set widget background color [#0000FFFF]...` for mana (blue), `set widget background color [#00FF00FF]...` for happiness (green). When story choices change the variable (`change [health v] by (-10)`), the slider automatically updates visually.

Topic: T15 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Scene manager sprite
Description: Create a dedicated "SceneManager" sprite (use `hide` to keep it invisible) that centralizes story flow control. Store the current scene in a variable: `set [currentScene v] to [1]`. When transitioning scenes, the SceneManager broadcasts: `broadcast (join [Scene] (currentScene))` and coordinates which sprites AND widgets appear or hide. Use `when green flag clicked` → `hide widget [button1 v]` to hide widgets from previous scenes, then `when I receive [Scene2]` → `show widget [button2 v]` to reveal widgets for the new scene. The SceneManager handles all scene transitions, widget visibility, background changes (`switch backdrop to [forest v]`), and story state tracking in one place. This architecture makes complex multi-scene stories easier to debug and expand.

Dependencies:
* T15.G6.03: Cutscene controller with custom blocks
* T15.G5.01: Coordinate scene changes with broadcasts
* T16.G5.01: Hide and show widgets
* T09.G5.01: Scene management requires variables to track current scene and state.

Skill: Split text at delimiter
Description: Parse structured text by finding delimiter characters (like ":") and extracting the parts before and after. Use a loop to find the delimiter position: `set [position v] to (0)`, `repeat (length of [text v])` with `if <(letter (i) of (text)) = [:]> then set [position v] to (i)`. Once found, extract the parts: `set [beforeColon v] to (letter (1) to (position) of (text))` for everything before the delimiter, `set [afterColon v] to (letter ((position) + (2)) to (length of (text)) of (text))` for everything after (skip the colon itself with +2 to also skip the space). Use this to parse dialogue data like "Alice: Hello!" into speaker "Alice" and dialogue "Hello!". This prepares you for advanced dialogue systems with speaker tags.

Topic: T15 – Stories & Animation
Skill: Dialogue system with speaker tags
Description: Build a dialogue system where each list item in `[dialogueData v]` contains speaker name and text separated by a colon (e.g., "Alice: Hello there!", "Bob: Hi Alice!"). Loop through the list: `repeat (length of [dialogueData v])` with `set [currentLine v] to (item (i) of [dialogueData v])`. Parse each line using text splitting techniques from T15.G7.03 to extract `[speaker v]` and `[dialogue v]`. Use broadcasts to make the correct sprite speak: `broadcast (join [speak_] (speaker))`, then in each character sprite: `when I receive [speak_Alice]` → `say (dialogue)`. This creates a centralized dialogue system where you write conversations in a list ("Alice: Hi", "Bob: Hey") and the sprites automatically speak their lines. Easy to edit dialogue without changing code.

Dependencies:
* T15.G6.02: List-based Dialogue
* T15.G7.03: Split text at delimiter
* T07.G5.01: Dialogue systems iterate through conversation sequences.

Skill: Encode story state for saving
Description: Combine the current node ID, score variables, and key story flags into a single string that can be saved and loaded later. Use nested `join` blocks to create a save string with "|" delimiters: `set [saveData v] to (join (currentNode) (join [|] (join (score) (join [|] (hasKey)))))` creates "node3|score5|true". Add more variables with more join operations. Save this string to a cloud variable `set [☁ SaveGame v] to (saveData)` so it persists across sessions and devices, or display it to the player: `say (join [Your save code: ] (saveData))` and let them copy it manually. Cloud variables require an account and internet connection; save codes work offline but require manual copying.

Description: Parse a saved state string back into individual variables to restore game progress. If loading from cloud variable: `set [saveData v] to (☁ SaveGame)`. If loading from player input: create a textbox widget for the player to paste their save code, then `set [saveData v] to (value of widget [loadBox v])`. Split the string by "|" delimiter using the technique from T15.G7.03. Find each "|" position and extract the parts: first part is current node, second part is score, third part is flags. Restore each variable: `set [currentNode v] to (part 1)`, `set [score v] to (part 2)`, etc. After restoring all variables, broadcast the current node to resume the story: `broadcast (join [Node] (currentNode))`. Test your save/load system thoroughly to ensure all important variables are preserved.

Description: Use `show speech bubble [Hello!] offset xyz (0) (0) (110) max width (200) text font [Arial v] size (15) color [#000000FF] background [#FFFFFFFF] for [3] seconds camera facing [Yes v] ID [1 v]` to create speech bubbles in 3D projects. Unlike 2D speech bubbles that appear above sprites, 3D speech bubbles float in 3D space at a specific XYZ offset relative to the sprite object. The offset (0, 0, 110) places the bubble 110 units above the sprite's center. Set "camera facing" to [Yes] to make the bubble automatically rotate to face the camera, ensuring text is always readable regardless of camera angle. The "max width" parameter controls text wrapping. Use different "ID" values ([1 v], [2 v]) to show multiple bubbles simultaneously from the same sprite. Combine with 3D animations for immersive storytelling in 3D environments.

Skill: Understand sprite replication in multiplayer games
Description: Students learn that when a sprite is registered with the multiplayer game, it appears on all connected players' screens automatically. The "original" sprite exists on the player who registered it, and "replicate" sprites appear on other players' screens. They understand that position updates on the original automatically synchronize to replicates. They explain why replication is necessary (so all players see the same game world) and how it works (network messages broadcast position/state changes).

Topic: T19 – Multiplayer Apps: Grade 6–8 Skill List
Skill: Understand how code runs on original vs replicate sprites
Description: Students learn that code blocks run only on the original sprite by default, not on replicate sprites. Input controls (arrow keys) should only affect the local player's sprite (the original), not remote players' replicates. They test this by adding print statements and observing which window shows output. They understand this prevents conflicts (multiple players trying to control the same sprite) and allows each player to control only their own sprite while seeing others' sprites as replicates.

Skill: Understand Dynamic vs Static sprites in multiplayer games
Description: Students learn the difference between Dynamic and Static sprites in multiplayer. Dynamic sprites are for moving objects (players, enemies, projectiles) and their positions synchronize continuously. Static sprites are for fixed objects (walls, platforms, obstacles) and their positions never change, using less network bandwidth. They categorize at least 10 game objects as Dynamic or Static. They explain the performance trade-off: Dynamic sprites synchronize smoothly but use more network traffic, Static sprites are efficient but can't move.

Topic: T19 – Multiplayer Apps: Grade 6–8 Skill List
Skill: Understand collision shapes (Rectangle vs Circle) in multiplayer games
Description: Students learn that multiplayer sprites need collision shapes for hit detection: Rectangle for box-shaped objects (walls, crates, platforms) and Circle for round objects (balls, circular players). They understand that collision shapes must match sprite appearance for accurate gameplay. They test collision detection with both shapes and observe differences. They explain why choosing the right shape matters: better accuracy, smoother gameplay, and fair collision detection across all players.

Topic: T19 – Multiplayer Apps: Grade 6–8 Skill List
Skill: Understand synchronization mechanisms in depth
Description: Students learn the technical details of how CreatiCode synchronizes game state. They understand that synchronized movement blocks automatically send position updates through the network. Broadcasting messages explicitly synchronizes events (player scored, game started). They compare automatic synchronization (positions of Dynamic sprites) to manual synchronization (broadcasts for custom events). They explain when to use each: continuous data (movement) uses synchronized blocks, discrete events (scoring, collecting) use broadcasts.

Topic: T19 – Multiplayer Apps: Grade 6–8 Skill List
Skill: Understand what lag and latency mean in multiplayer games
Description: Students learn that "lag" or "latency" is the delay between an action and seeing it on other players' screens. They understand this delay is caused by network message travel time (physical distance, internet speed). They identify how lag affects gameplay: high lag makes games feel unresponsive, low lag feels smooth and immediate. They test games on different server locations and observe lag differences. They explain why some games are more affected by lag than others (fast-paced action games vs turn-based strategy).

Dependencies:
* T05.G5.01: Write clear user needs and requirements for a small app

Topic: T19 – Multiplayer Apps: Grade 6–8 Skill List
Skill: Understand what servers are in multiplayer games
Description: Students learn that servers are computers that relay messages between players and store game rooms. CreatiCode provides servers in different geographic locations (US-East, US-West, Europe, Asia). They understand that all players must connect to the same server to play together. They explain why server location matters (closer servers = lower lag) and why servers are necessary (relay messages, maintain game room, validate actions).

Skill: Understand what roles are in multiplayer games
Description: Students learn that "roles" are labels assigned to players (e.g., "red team", "builder", "seeker", "guard") that can be used to give different behaviors or responsibilities. They understand that roles are optional text labels that don't automatically change behavior - developers must write code to check roles and act accordingly. They identify examples of role-based games (asymmetric games, team games, job-based games). They explain how roles enable game variety: players can have different abilities, objectives, or team assignments.

Skill: Implement role-based tag behaviors
Description: Students implement different behaviors for taggers versus runners using role conditionals. Taggers can tag others (trigger collision events), runners try to avoid taggers. They use the player's role to determine which behavior to execute. They test with two windows by assigning different roles and verifying each role behaves correctly. They understand that role-based conditionals create asymmetric gameplay where different players have different objectives.

Description: Students configure multiplayer collision blocks to detect when the tagger touches a runner. They set collision behavior to "continue" (players pass through each other, not stop) and trigger a "tagged" message. They attach parameters to identify which player was tagged. They test with two windows by moving players into collision and verifying the message fires.

Skill: Choose between "All Sprites" and "Exclude Replicate" broadcast modes
Description: Students learn the two broadcast modes in multiplayer games. "All Sprites" mode sends the message to all sprites on all clients (originals and replicates). "Exclude Replicate" mode sends only to original sprites (skips replicates). They test both modes and observe the difference: "All Sprites" may cause duplicate actions if replicates also respond, "Exclude Replicate" ensures each player's code runs only once. They choose the appropriate mode based on whether they want actions to run on all sprites or only on original/controlling sprites.

Skill: Configure stop vs continue collision behavior
Description: Students learn the two basic collision behaviors in multiplayer collision blocks. "Stop" makes both sprites stop moving when they collide (solid collision for walls, obstacles). "Continue" lets sprites pass through each other (trigger zones, collectibles, pass-through collisions). They test both behaviors and observe differences.

Skill: Create a semantic search database
Description: Students use the `create semantic database from table [TABLE v]` block to build a vector database using Pinecone. They prepare a table with a 'key' column (text to be searchable, e.g., FAQ questions, product descriptions, document excerpts) and optional metadata columns (category, date, author). They understand how semantic search works: text is converted to embeddings (vector representations, typically 1536 dimensions) that capture meaning, enabling similarity-based search where "What's your phone number?" matches "Contact: 555-1234" even without shared keywords. Only one database per project is supported.

## GRADE 6 SKILLS

ID: T23.G6.01.01
Topic: T23 – AI Perception
Skill: Capture a single spoken phrase with basic speech recognition
Description: Students use the basic speech recognition flow: `start recognizing speech in [English (United States) v] record as []` (with default language), wait briefly, then `end speech recognition` to capture a single spoken word or phrase. The recognized text is stored in a variable (not in a table). They display the result using the `text from speech` reporter block and a `say` block or variable monitor. Common issues include silent rooms (no input detected), background noise (mis-recognition), and recognition delay (typically 1-3 seconds after speaking stops). They learn the workflow: start detection → speak → wait for processing → end detection → read result. They understand that the system listens continuously while detection is active and that ending detection triggers the final transcription. They implement basic error handling for empty results (no speech detected).

Skill: Understand hand detection table structure
Description: Students learn the hand detection table structure: 47 rows per detected hand organized into three sections: (1) rows 1-5 contain finger summaries (thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky) with columns [hand, part, curl, dir, x, y, z], (2) rows 6-26 contain 2D landmark positions, (3) rows 27-47 contain 3D landmark positions. They identify which row contains specific finger data and understand that curl ranges from 0° (fully closed/fist) to 180° (fully extended/straight), direction ranges from 0° to 360° indicating pointing direction, and x/y are screen coordinates while z is depth. They practice locating specific data: "Which row has index finger curl?" (row 2). IMPORTANT: Curl and dir values are ONLY available in rows 1-5 (finger summaries), NOT in the landmark rows.

Skill: Read finger direction data for advanced gesture recognition
Description: Students extend hand detection by reading the direction (dir) column from the hand detection table (rows 1-5). Each finger summary has a direction indicating which way it's pointing (up, down, left, right). They combine curl and direction to recognize complex gestures: "thumbs up" = thumb extended (curl > 170) + pointing up, "peace sign" = index and middle extended + pointing up.

Skill: Apply moving average to smooth noisy sensor data
Description: Students implement moving average smoothing: store the last 5 wrist position readings in a list, calculate the average of these values, and use the averaged position to move a sprite. They observe how averaging reduces jittery movement and understand the trade-off between smoothness (larger window) and responsiveness (smaller window). They learn when to apply smoothing (continuous tracking) vs when not to (detecting quick gestures).

Skill: Use clamping to limit sensor values to valid ranges
Description: Students implement value clamping to constrain sensor readings to valid ranges. They use conditional blocks to check if a value exceeds boundaries and reset it to the boundary value: `if position < 0 then set position to 0`, `if position > 480 then set position to 480`. They apply clamping to prevent sprites from moving off-screen, keep angles within 0-360 range, and filter out impossible sensor values that indicate errors.

Skill: Implement debouncing to filter rapid fluctuations
Description: Students implement debouncing to ignore rapid changes in sensor data. They require a value to remain stable for a minimum time (e.g., 0.5 seconds) before accepting it as valid. For gesture detection, they check that a gesture is maintained for multiple consecutive frames (3+ frames) before triggering an action. This prevents false positives from brief sensor noise or accidental hand movements. They understand the trade-off between reliability and responsiveness.

They track the time since last valid sensor reading and trigger recovery actions if too much time passes (e.g., 2 seconds with no hand detected). Recovery actions include: displaying "hand not detected" message, switching to alternative input mode, or restarting the detection system. They handle scenarios where hands temporarily leave the camera frame and distinguish between brief dropouts (ignore) and extended absence (notify user).

Skill: Choose continuous vs. event-driven detection patterns
Description: Students compare two detection patterns: (1) continuous polling in forever loop (constantly read table and update), (2) event-driven (start detection, wait for specific condition, then act). They implement both patterns with hand detection: continuous mode moves sprite smoothly following hand, event-driven mode triggers action when gesture detected. They discuss trade-offs: continuous is smooth but CPU-intensive, event-driven is efficient but may miss quick gestures.

Skill: Synchronize variables across projects using cloud sessions
Description: Students use `create cloud session` and `join cloud session` blocks to enable real-time sharing of cloud variables across multiple instances of the same CreatiCode project. They build collaborative features where one user's variable changes appear instantly for others: synchronized counters, shared text displays, collaborative drawing coordinates, or shared data dashboards. They understand that cloud sessions synchronize ONLY cloud variables—not sprites, physics, costumes, or game state. Each session requires a unique ID, and only projects connected to the same session will share variables. They test isolation by connecting to different sessions (no sync) versus the same session (full variable sync).
