GRADE 2 CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCY ADDITIONS (T12-T20)
Conservative Analysis - Only Clearly Necessary Dependencies
================================================================================

TOPIC T12 – ORGANIZING PROGRAMS (Documentation)
----------------------------------------
T12.G2.02: Add dependency T01.G1.01 - Reason: Understanding sequences is needed before labeling sections of a plan


TOPIC T13 – TESTING, DEBUGGING & ERROR HANDLING
----------------------------------------
T13.G2.04: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: Adding checks requires conditional thinking (if goal reached then show success)


TOPIC T14 – 2D GAMES
----------------------------------------
T14.G2.02: Add dependency T02.G1.01 - Reason: Tracking lives requires understanding of counting and data tracking
T14.G2.03: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: Level progression requires conditional logic (if goal touched then next level)


TOPIC T15 – STORIES & ANIMATION
----------------------------------------
T15.G2.01: Add dependency T04.G1.01 - Reason: Comparing animation speeds requires recognizing patterns in movement sequences
T15.G2.03: Add dependency T04.G2.01 - Reason: Identifying repeating animation patterns requires pattern recognition skills
T15.G2.03: Add dependency T07.G1.01 - Reason: Understanding loops in animation requires loop concept understanding


TOPIC T16 – USER INTERFACES
----------------------------------------
T16.G2.01: Add dependency T08.G1.01 - Reason: UI interactions are conditional (if button pressed then action happens)
T16.G2.02: Add dependency T03.G1.02 - Reason: Designing interfaces requires organizing related elements into groups


TOPIC T18 – 3D WORLDS & GAMES
----------------------------------------
T18.G2.01: Add dependency T17.G1.01 - Reason: Understanding 3D viewpoints builds on 2D motion and direction concepts


TOPIC T20 – ALGORITHMIC ART & CREATIVE CODING
----------------------------------------
T20.G2.01: Add dependency T04.G1.01 - Reason: Using repeat in art requires understanding of pattern recognition
T20.G2.02: Add dependency T04.G1.02 - Reason: Creating symmetrical patterns requires understanding of pattern structures
T20.G2.03: Add dependency T04.G2.02 - Reason: Layering patterns requires recognizing repeated sequences in algorithms

SUMMARY STATISTICS
================================================================================
Total G2 skills analyzed: 24
Skills needing additional dependencies: 11
Total dependency additions: 13
Topics with no changes needed: T17 (already has appropriate dependencies)

Most common missing dependency types:
  - T04 (Pattern Recognition): 6 additions
  - T08 (Conditional Logic): 3 additions
  - T01 (Sequencing): 1 addition
  - T02 (Data/Algorithms): 1 addition
  - T03 (Decomposition): 1 addition
  - T07 (Loops): 1 addition
  - T17 (2D Motion): 1 addition

All recommendations comply with X-2 rule (Grade 2 skills only depend on K, 1, or 2).
