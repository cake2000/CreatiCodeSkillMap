# T03 Problem Decomposition - Phase 1 Optimization Summary

## Overview
Successfully optimized all T03 skills across grades K-8 with focus on internal topic coherence, proper scaffolding, and skill clarity.

## Changes at a Glance
- **Skills Before:** 50
- **Skills After:** 52
- **New Skills Added:** 2
- **Skills Modified:** 8
- **Skills Deleted:** 0
- **Dependencies Fixed:** 2

## Major Improvements

### 1. Split Overly Complex Skill (HIGH Priority)
**T03.G3.06** was trying to teach two concepts simultaneously:
- **NEW T03.G3.05.01:** "Identify main parts in a simple project" (focused on recognition)
- **REVISED T03.G3.06:** "Understand how project parts work together" (focused on interactions)

### 2. Added Critical Bridge Skills (HIGH Priority)
**T03.G2.04.01:** "Recognize that related subtasks can be grouped as features"
- Bridges the gap between subtasks (G2.04) and features (G2.05)
- Essential for Grade 2 conceptual progression

### 3. Enhanced Skill Descriptions (HIGH Priority)
Made descriptions more concrete and measurable:
- **T03.G4.01:** Added component responsibility examples
- **T03.G4.04:** Added task ownership and sequencing examples
- **T03.G5.04:** Emphasized measurable outcomes
- **T03.G6.04:** Added timeline and impact analysis requirements
- **T03.G7.04:** Added Scratch-specific structural examples
- **T03.G8.04:** Added complete scope reduction scenario

### 4. Fixed Dependency Issues (HIGH Priority)
- **T03.G4.05:** Removed redundant G3.05 dependency
- **T03.G4.06:** Now depends on G4.05 (same grade) instead of G3.05
- Creates logical Grade 4 progression: create lists → identify problems → update plans

## New Learning Progressions

### Progression 1: From Subtasks to Features (Grades 2-3)
```
G2.04 (Track subtasks)
  ↓
G2.04.01 (Group related subtasks as features) ← NEW
  ↓
G2.05 (Identify project features)
  ↓
G3.01 (Identify features in descriptions)
```

### Progression 2: From Parts to Components (Grades 3-4)
```
G3.05 (Plan projects with features/scenes)
  ↓
G3.05.01 (Identify main project parts) ← NEW
  ↓
G3.06 (Understand how parts work together)
  ↓
G4.01 (Break into components with responsibilities)
```

### Progression 3: Plan Refinement (Grade 4)
```
G4.04 (Create detailed task lists)
  ↓
G4.05 (Identify problems in plans)
  ↓
G4.06 (Update plans based on feedback)
```

## Quality Assurance Checks

✅ No skills deleted
✅ All cross-topic dependencies preserved (T01, T02, T04, T06, T07, T08, T09)
✅ Only T03 skills modified
✅ Sub-IDs used for new skills (.01 format)
✅ X-2 rule applied (dependencies only at grades X, X-1, X-2)
✅ K-2 skills remain picture-based/unplugged
✅ Grade 3+ involve block-based coding appropriately
✅ No circular dependencies created
✅ All HIGH priority fixes implemented
✅ All MEDIUM priority fixes implemented

## Impact

The T03 topic now has:
- **Better scaffolding:** Critical bridge skills fill conceptual gaps
- **Clearer skills:** More concrete, measurable descriptions
- **Logical progression:** Dependencies flow naturally within grades
- **Age-appropriate:** K-2 unplugged, 3+ block-based
- **Manageable scope:** No overly broad skills requiring breakdown

## Files Modified

- **Main file:** `skillsv4/allskills.md`
- **Backup created:** `skillsv4/allskills_backup_before_T03_optimization_[timestamp].md`

## Next Steps

This completes Phase 1 optimization for T03. The topic is now internally coherent and ready for Phase 2 (cross-topic dependency validation).
