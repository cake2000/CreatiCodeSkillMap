## Description Quality Improvements

### Example 1: T10.G3.01
**BEFORE:**
> "Create a list and add items to it"

**AFTER:**
> "Students create a new list variable (e.g., 'fruits' or 'scores') and use the `add [item] to [list]` block to add 3-4 items one at a time. They check the 'show list' option to see the list monitor on stage and understand that a list holds multiple values in order. This is the foundational skill for all list operations."

**Improvements:**
- Specific block name mentioned
- Concrete examples given
- Visual feedback noted
- Foundation concept explained

---

### Example 2: T10.G7.05
**BEFORE:**
> "Fix string formatting issues in table cells (trim whitespace, change case, remove unwanted characters)."

**AFTER:**
> "Students detect and fix data quality issues in tables: trim whitespace, standardize case, remove invalid characters, handle missing values, and validate data types. They write code to loop through rows and apply cleaning transformations."

**Improvements:**
- Broader scope (not just strings)
- Includes data types and missing values
- Mentions implementation (loop through rows)
- More realistic to actual data cleaning

---

### Example 3: T10.G7.10 (New)
**AFTER:**
> "Students use CreatiCode's AI blocks to ask questions about table data (e.g., 'What are the key insights from this sales data?' or 'Summarize the trends in this dataset'). They learn how AI can assist with data analysis."

**Improvements:**
- Specific feature mentioned (AI blocks)
- Concrete example questions
- Learning objective stated
- Platform-specific

---
