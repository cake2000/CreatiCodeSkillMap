## SUMMARY BY CHANGE CATEGORY

X-2 Rule Violations Flagged: 18
Cross-Topic Dependencies Added: 839
Circular Dependencies Found: 0
Transitive Redundancies Flagged: 123
Total Issues Identified: 980

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

Average dependencies per Grade 8 skill: 5.63
Maximum dependencies in a single skill: 11

Skills with cross-topic dependencies: 289/291

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   - Review 18 skills with X-2 violations
   - Add scaffolding skills for Grade 6-8 where dependencies skip too many grades

2. VALIDATION:
   - Verify 839 cross-topic dependencies added
   - Ensure they align with actual skill requirements

3. CONSERVATIVE CHANGES:
   - 123 potential redundancies were FLAGGED but NOT removed
   - Review these to determine if they're truly redundant or needed for direct teaching
