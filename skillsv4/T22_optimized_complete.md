ID: T22.G7.08.01
Topic: T22 – Chatbots & Prompting
Skill: Use the generic LLM block to compare different models
Description: Students use the `LLM model [PROVIDER] request [PROMPT]` block with both "small" and "large" model options to compare response quality, speed, and cost trade-offs. They build a comparison tool that shows how different models answer the same prompt, learning when to use smaller/faster models vs larger/more capable ones.

Topic: T22 – Chatbots & Prompting
Skill: Set system instructions for generic LLM models
Description: Students use the `LLM set system instruction [INSTRUCTION] for model [PROVIDER]` block to configure the behavior of different LLM models. They learn how system instructions work across different model providers and compare how various models respond to the same system instructions.

Dependencies:
* T22.G6.02: Adjust temperature for response creativity
* T22.G7.01: Use system messages to set bot behavior
* T22.G7.08.01: Use the generic LLM block to compare different models


ID: T22.G7.09
Topic: T22 – Chatbots & Prompting
Skill: User-test the chatbot for inclusivity and clarity
Description: Students prepare at least four tester personas (age, language level, accessibility need), run scripted conversations, and note where the bot confuses or excludes users. They adjust prompts or UI affordances (e.g., add a "simplify answer" button) and document changes. This works with either custom-built conversation displays or pre-built chat windows.

Dependencies:
* T22.G6.07: Debug off-topic responses by rewriting prompts
* T22.G7.02.01: Create and use custom personas with system messages

ID: T22.G8.04
Topic: T22 – Chatbots & Prompting
Skill: Create an automated chatbot testing and reporting system
Description: Students build a testing harness that runs their chatbot through a suite of test prompts (stored in a table), logs each response, flags moderation events, and generates a summary report showing pass/fail rates and edge cases.
