# T32 – Cybersecurity & Digital Safety: K–8 Skill List (Draft v2)

Topic reference: `T32 Cybersecurity & Safety` in `domains_topics_overview.md`
Domain: Systems & Security (D5) · CSTA focus: SAS‑SC, CAS‑ET (links to PRO‑PM, CAS‑HC)

Each skill below has:

- a stable **ID** (`T32.G<grade>.<nn>`),
- an IXL-style **short name**,
- a **description** (what understanding/behavior it targets),
- a **challenge format** (the typical problem type to assess it).

Where relevant, a primary **CSTA code** is noted.

**Role and scope in v3:** Cybersecurity spans personal safety (K–4), responsible collaboration (5–6), and system-level defenses (7–8). Students first develop instincts around sharing, trusted adults, and device care. As they move into coding-heavy grades, they secure their CreatiCode projects (password hygiene, account protection, secure data handling) and apply ethical guidelines when building AI helpers (T21–T24). By middle school, they analyze threats, simulate attacks, deploy mitigations, and document policies (AI4K12: human oversight, societal impact). T32 dovetails with T25–T27 data topics (protecting logs), T28 simulations (threat modeling), and T30 hardware (sensor privacy).
