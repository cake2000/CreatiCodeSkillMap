### Key Metrics
- **Total Skills:** 28 (increased from 27)
- **Skills Modified:** 5
- **Skills Added:** 1 (T34.G5.04)
- **Skills Enhanced:** 1 (T34.G6.02)
- **Dependency Updates:** 9 cross-references updated
- **Critical Issues Resolved:** 0 (none found)
- **Quality Improvements:** 7

## Changes Made

### 1. **T34.G1.03 - Made More Specific** ✅
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** Description Improvement

**Before:**
```
Explain that technology choices shape games/apps
```

**After:**
```
Explain how choosing different programming tools (blocks vs. text, 2D vs. 3D engine)
changes what games and apps can do, using specific examples
```

**Rationale:** Original was too vague. New version provides concrete examples of technology choices and requires students to demonstrate understanding with specific examples.

---

### 2. **T34.G2.02 - Added Structure** ✅
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** Description Improvement

**Before:**
```
Identify communities impacted by inventions
```

**After:**
```
Create a 3-part chart showing (1) an invention, (2) communities it helped, and
(3) communities it left out or harmed
```

**Rationale:** Transforms vague identification into structured critical analysis. Ensures students consider both positive and negative impacts and creates a clear, assessable deliverable.

---

### 3. **T34.G5.01 - Clarified Scope** ✅
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** Description Improvement

**Before:**
```
Investigate social movements linked to computing
```

**After:**
```
Research 2-3 social movements where computing played a key role (e.g., civil rights
data collection, open-source movement, accessibility advocacy) and present findings
```

**Rationale:** Added specific quantity (2-3 movements), concrete examples for guidance, and clear deliverable (present findings).

**Cross-References Updated:**
- T34.G6.01 (dependency)
- T34.G6.02 (dependency)
- T34.G6.03 (dependency)

---

### 4. **T34.G6.01 - Removed Redundancy & Expanded** ✅
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** Description Improvement

**Before:**
```
Analyze waves of computing (mainframe → mobile → AI)
```

**After:**
```
Analyze major waves of computing (mainframe → personal computer → internet →
mobile → AI), identifying what each wave made possible and what barriers remained
```

**Rationale:** Expanded from 3 to 5 waves (adding personal computer and internet, which are critical milestones). Added analytical framework (possibilities vs. barriers) to make skill more substantive.

**Cross-References Updated:**
- T34.G7.01 (dependency)
- T34.G7.02 (dependency)

---

### 5. **T34.G6.03 - Used Active Verb** ✅
**Priority:** HIGH
**Type:** Description Improvement

**Before:**
```
Learn from historical computing failures
```

**After:**
```
Analyze historical computing failures (e.g., Therac-25, Y2K, failed AI systems) to
identify lessons for preventing similar problems today
```

**Rationale:** Changed passive "learn" to active "analyze". Added specific examples (Therac-25, Y2K, failed AI) and clear purpose (identify preventive lessons).

**Cross-References Updated:**
- T34.G7.01 (dependency)
- T34.G7.03 (dependency)

---

### 6. **T34.G5.04 - NEW SKILL ADDED** ✅
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Type:** Content Gap Filled

**New Skill:**
```
ID: T34.G5.04
Topic: T34 – Computing History
Skill: Trace evolution of programming languages from machine code to modern tools

Dependencies:
* T34.G4.03: Link hardware evolution to modern software features
* T34.G5.02: Compare invention timelines across industries
```

**Rationale:** Filled significant content gap. Original T34 covered hardware evolution (T34.G4.03) and user interface evolution (T34.G6.02 enhanced), but programming language evolution was missing. This is a critical dimension of computing history.

**Placement:** Inserted after T34.G5.03 and before T34.G6.01 (Grade 5).

---

### 7. **T34.G6.02 - Enhanced with UI Evolution** ✅
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Type:** Content Enhancement

**Before:**
```
Evaluate historical inclusion and exclusion in computing
```

**After:**
```
Evaluate historical inclusion and exclusion in computing, including how user interface
evolution (command line → GUI → touchscreen → voice) has changed who can use computers
```

**Rationale:** Added concrete dimension (UI evolution) to make inclusion analysis more specific and actionable. Provides clear progression framework and explicitly connects interface design to accessibility.

**Cross-References Updated:**
- T34.G7.02 (dependency)
- T34.G7.03 (dependency)

## Recommendations for Phase 2

When conducting Phase 2 (inter-topic dependencies):

1. **Review T01 dependencies:** T34.G2.01 and T34.G2.03 both depend on T01.G1.01 ("Put pictures in order"). Verify this is the most appropriate G1 algorithm skill for T34 G2 skills.

2. **Consider adding cross-topic links:**
   - T34.G5.04 (programming languages) could benefit from connection to T11 (Functions) or T12 (Code Organization)
   - T34.G7.01 (AI history) could link to T21-T24 (AI application topics)

3. **Potential capstone connections:**
   - T34.G8.03 (primary research) could serve as a culminating project that draws on multiple topics
