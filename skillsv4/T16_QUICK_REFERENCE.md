## Common Dependency Patterns

Most T16 skills depend on:
- **T06 (Events):** Event handling foundations
- **T08 (Conditionals):** Decision-making logic  
- **T09 (Variables):** Data storage and manipulation
- **T07 (Loops):** Repetition and iteration
- **T01-T05:** Foundational algorithm thinking

## Widget Block Usage Patterns

1. **Create widget** → Set initial properties
2. **Handle events** (click, change, hover)
3. **Read/write values** (get user input, update display)
4. **Style** (appearance, text formatting)
5. **Animate** (move, resize, fade)
6. **Manage** (show/hide, remove, layer)

## Key Concepts Progression

**K-2:** Recognition → Unplugged design
**G3:** Basic creation → Event handling
**G4:** Styling → Multiple input types
**G5:** Multi-screen → Media integration
**G6:** Usability → Accessibility → Responsive
**G7:** Real-world patterns → Data visualization
**G8:** Advanced patterns → Analysis → Testing
