## Rationale by Dependency Type

### 1. Algorithmic Thinking Dependencies (T01, T02)
**Why:** Almost all computing concepts require understanding of sequential steps and procedures. Skills involving processes, instructions, or step-by-step tasks need algorithmic foundation.

**Examples:**
- Game design needs to understand sequences
- Debugging needs to understand what algorithms should do
- Data collection checklists follow sequential processes

### 2. Data Organization Dependencies (T10)
**Why:** Many skills involve categorizing, comparing, or organizing information. Understanding data structures is fundamental to sorting, grouping, and classifying tasks.

**Examples:**
- Text processing (sorting words)
- AI literacy (categorizing tools)
- Interface design (organizing elements)
- Cybersecurity (identifying threats vs. safe practices)

### 3. Pattern Recognition Dependencies (T04)
**Why:** Patterns appear throughout computing—in loops, data, algorithms, and creative work. Recognizing similarity and repetition is a transferable skill.

**Examples:**
- Loop understanding (counting repetitions)
- Creative computing (art patterns)
- Data analysis (finding trends)
- Algorithm comparison (identifying similar outcomes)

### 4. Event/Trigger Dependencies (T06)
**Why:** Many computing concepts involve cause-and-effect relationships. Understanding events helps with conditionals, interfaces, sensors, and decision-making.

**Examples:**
- Interface buttons trigger actions
- Sensors detect changes that cause responses
- Story consequences follow from actions
- Network connections/disconnections are state changes

### 5. Conditional Logic Dependencies (T08)
**Why:** If-then reasoning appears in rules, sorting, decision-making, and consequences. It's fundamental to game rules, data filtering, and branching logic.

**Examples:**
- Game rules (if this happens, then that occurs)
- Data sorting (if meets criteria, then place in group)
- Story consequences (if character does X, then Y happens)

### 6. Decomposition Dependencies (T03)
**Why:** Breaking problems into parts is essential for design, planning, and problem-solving across all domains.

**Examples:**
- Algorithm creation (break task into steps)
- System understanding (identify components)
- Interface design (arrange parts)

### 7. Counting/Tracking Dependencies (T09)
**Why:** Variables for counting appear in games (scores), data (tallies), loops (iterations), and text processing (word counts).

### 8. Abstraction Dependencies (T12)
**Why:** Naming, labeling, and representing ideas at higher levels helps with organization, communication, and simplification.

3. **T07.G1.02** (Match "do N times"): 4 dependencies
4. **T13.G1.03** (Change number to fix): 4 dependencies
5. **T20.G1.04** (Fix wrong instruction): 4 dependencies
6. **T26.G1.03** (Use checklist): 4 dependencies
7. **T36.G1.03** (Listening behaviors): 3 dependencies

### Topics with Most External Dependencies
1. **T20 (Creative Computing)**: All 4 skills have cross-topic deps
2. **T14 (Game Design)**: All 5 skills have cross-topic deps
3. **T02 (Algorithm Design)**: All 5 skills have cross-topic deps
4. **T13 (Debugging)**: All 3 skills have cross-topic deps

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review & Validate**: Subject matter experts should review recommendations for appropriateness
2. **Prioritize**: Identify which dependencies are critical vs. helpful
3. **Apply to Curriculum**: Update allskills.md with approved dependencies
4. **Test Coherence**: Verify no circular dependencies are created
5. **Iterate**: Repeat analysis for Grades 2-5

## Analysis Methodology

### Tools Used
- Python script: `comprehensive_grade1_cross_topic_analyzer.py`
- Input: `/media/binyu/USB2/dev/CreatiCodeSkillMap/skillsv4/allskills.md`
- Output: This report + `grade1_cross_topic_recommendations.txt`

### Keyword Matching Rules
The analyzer searched skill titles and descriptions for:
- **Algorithmic**: step, sequence, order, routine, algorithm, instruction, direction
- **Decomposition**: break, part, divide, component, separate
- **Patterns**: pattern, repeat, similar, same
- **Design**: design, create, plan, solution, need, user
- **Events**: event, trigger, when, cause, happen, start
- **Loops**: loop, times, again, multiple, repetition
- **Conditionals**: if, then, condition, rule, sort, filter
- **Variables**: count, track, store, remember, score
- **Data**: table, list, organize, sort, group, category
- **Abstraction**: abstract, general, simplify, represent, symbol
- **Debugging**: debug, error, fix, mistake, wrong, correct

### Confidence Level
**HIGH** - Recommendations based on clear conceptual relationships and keyword matches. Liberal approach means some dependencies might be optional rather than critical, but all are pedagogically sound.
