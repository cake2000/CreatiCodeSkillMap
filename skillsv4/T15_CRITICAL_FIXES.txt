T15 (STORIES & ANIMATION) - CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED
================================================================================

🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - INCORRECT BLOCK SYNTAX 🚨

These skills show WRONG syntax that doesn't match actual CreatiCode blocks:

1. T15.G3.10 - Enhanced say with styling
   ❌ CURRENT: Shows parameters in wrong format
   ✅ CORRECT: say [TEXT] for (T) seconds text size (FONTSIZE) [FONTCOLOR] 
               background [BACKGROUNDCOLOR] edge [EDGECOLOR]
   
2. T15.G3.05.01 - Style think bubbles  
   ❌ CURRENT: Shows parameters in wrong format
   ✅ CORRECT: think [TEXT] for (T) seconds text size (FONTSIZE) [FONTCOLOR]
               background [BACKGROUNDCOLOR] edge [EDGECOLOR]

IMPACT: Students will be confused when blocks don't match documentation!
ACTION: Update descriptions immediately using Implementation Solutions doc

================================================================================

⚠️  HIGH PRIORITY - MISSING CRITICAL SKILLS ⚠️

1. TEXT-TO-SPEECH FOUNDATION (missing!)
   - Platform has extensive TTS blocks (30+ languages, 8 voice types)
   - T15 jumps to "multi-language narration" (G6.04) with NO foundation
   - FIX: Add T15.G5.12 "Basic text-to-speech narration" first

2. SPEECH RECOGNITION FOUNDATION (missing!)
   - Platform has speech recognition blocks (Azure + Whisper API)
   - T15.G6.05 is the ONLY speech skill - no scaffolding
   - FIX: Add T15.G6.05 "Basic speech recognition", renumber old G6.05→G6.06

3. PROGRAMMATIC DRAWING vs PAINT EDITOR (confused!)
   - T15.G5.09, G5.10 say "paint editor" (manual tool)
   - But platform has BLOCKS: draw rectangle, draw oval, draw line, draw curve
   - These skills are in G5+ (coding grades) but describe manual editing
   - FIX: Modify to teach programmatic drawing blocks instead

4. BROADCAST AND WAIT (referenced but not taught!)
   - Multiple skills use "broadcast and wait" without teaching it
   - T15.G6.03 description mentions it but students never learned it
   - FIX: Add T15.G5.02.01 to teach the concept explicitly

5. GLIDE BLOCKS (mentioned but not taught!)
   - T15.G3.01 mentions glide in description but doesn't focus on it
   - Students don't learn difference between "go to" vs "glide"
   - FIX: Add T15.G3.01.01 to teach smooth movement explicitly

  TOTAL: 11 medium issues affecting 11 skills

LOW PRIORITY (Optional):
  ✓ 5 minor improvements → Small description tweaks
  
  TOTAL: 5 low issues

GRAND TOTAL: 26 issues requiring attention
             21 skills need modification or addition

🎯 RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION ORDER 🎯

PHASE 1 (2-3 hours) - DO FIRST:
  1. Fix T15.G3.10, T15.G3.05.01 syntax (copy from Implementation doc)
  2. Add T15.G5.12 (basic TTS)
  3. Modify T15.G6.04 (multi-language TTS with more detail)
  4. Add T15.G6.05 (basic speech recognition)
  5. Renumber current G6.05 → G6.06
  6. Modify T15.G3.00.03, G5.09, G5.10 (drawing clarification)

PHASE 2 (2 hours) - SCAFFOLDING:
  1. Add T15.G3.01.01 (glide)
  2. Add T15.G5.02.01 (broadcast and wait)
  3. Add T15.G5.11 (clear prints)
  4. Reorder G3.10 and G3.05.01 (move after G3.08)

PHASE 3 (2-3 hours) - WIDGETS:
  1. Add 4 new widget skills (styling, dropdowns, rich text, sliders)
  2. Modify T15.G7.01 (scene manager)

PHASE 4 (2-3 hours) - ADVANCED:
  1. Add advanced skills (timing, string parsing, 3D, camera)
  2. Modify save/load details

================================================================================

✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ✅

Before implementing, verify these exist in other topics:

[ ] T09.G7.01 - Cloud variables (for T15.G8.03)
[ ] T12.G4/G5 - String operations (for T15.G5.06, G7.03.01)
[ ] T14.G5.01 - AI understanding (for T15.G5.12, G6.05)
[ ] T16.G4.03 - Widget hide/show (for T15.G7.01)
[ ] T16.G5.05 - Rich textboxes (for T15.G6.07)
[ ] T16.G6.01 - Camera widgets (for T15.G8.05)
[ ] T17.G7.01 - 3D sprites (for T15.G8.04)

If missing: Either add to that topic first OR adjust T15 dependencies

================================================================================

📈 EXPECTED RESULTS 📈

Before: 61 skills
After:  76-78 skills (~25% expansion)

Quality improvements:
  ✓ Accurate block syntax matching platform
  ✓ Complete TTS/speech recognition progressions
  ✓ Clear distinction: paint editor vs drawing blocks
  ✓ Better widget integration for interactive stories
  ✓ Proper scaffolding for advanced features

Student impact:
  ✓ Less confusion from incorrect documentation
  ✓ Smoother learning curves with better scaffolding
  ✓ Access to full platform capabilities (currently underutilized)
  ✓ More engaging stories with widgets and voice features

  ✓ Programmatic drawing blocks (rectangles, ovals, lines, curves)
  ✓ Widget styling (colors, borders, fonts)
  ✓ Rich textboxes with formatting
  ✓ Dropdown menus for story choices
  ✓ Slider widgets for stat visualization
  ✓ Camera widgets for interactive stories
  ✓ 3D speech bubbles for 3D stories
