## Key Improvements

### 1. ✓ Fixed K-2 Grade Appropriateness (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Three G2 skills contained coding terminology inappropriate for picture-based learning.

**Fixed Skills:**
- **T04.G2.03** - Removed "algorithm descriptions," emphasized visual pattern comparison
- **T04.G2.04** - Removed coding preparation language, focused on visual "repeat" notation
- **T04.G2.05** - Removed "bridges to block coding," kept purely visual organization

**Impact:** G2 skills now properly align with K-2 picture-based, unplugged approach.

---

### 2. ✓ Broke Bottleneck at Grade 5 (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** All four G5 pattern types depended on single G4 skill (high cognitive load).

**Solution:** Added **T04.G4.07 - Recognize a simple counter pattern in code**
- Provides concrete counter example before abstract pattern recognition
- Moves foundational pattern to G4 where students first encounter variables
- Updated T04.G5.01 dependencies to build on this concrete foundation

**Impact:** Students now have scaffolding from concrete counter (G4) → abstract patterns (G5).

---

### 3. ✓ Broke Down Overly Complex Skills (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Two G7 skills combined 4-5 distinct cognitive tasks each.

**T04.G7.03 → 3 sub-skills:**
1. **G7.03.01** - Identify problems requiring multiple patterns
2. **G7.03.02** - Outline solution combining two patterns
3. **G7.03.03** - Implement combined pattern solution

**T04.G7.04 → 2 sub-skills:**
1. **G7.04.01** - Trace composite pattern and identify each pattern used
2. **G7.04.02** - Explain role of each pattern

**Impact:** Reduced cognitive load, created clear identify → outline → implement progression.

---

### 4. ✓ Added Application Skills (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Heavy focus on pattern recognition, weak on application.

**Added Skills:**
- **T04.G5.07** - Apply a counter pattern to solve a counting problem
- **T04.G6.07** - Implement a pattern-based solution from a description

**Impact:** Bridges the gap from recognize → apply → implement, enabling skill transfer.

---

### 5. ✓ Enhanced Template Progression (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Template skills scattered across G3-G6 with gaps and overlaps.

**Solution:** Added **T04.G4.08 - Use a template to create a customized project**

**New Progression:**
- G3: Recognize template (G3.03) → Customize simple template (G3.04)
- G4: **Use template to create project (G4.08)** ← NEW
- G5: Identify changeable vs fixed parts (G5.06)
- G6: Analyze complex template (G6.05)

**Impact:** Clear progression from recognition → simple customization → project creation → analysis.

---

### 6. ✓ Added Visual-to-Code Bridge (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** G2 ended with visual "repeat box" but G3 started with code blocks (missing bridge).

**Solution:** Added **T04.G3.08 - Match a repeat box diagram to code blocks**

**Impact:** Explicit transition from G2 visual notation to G3 block coding.

---

## Validation Results

### ✓ X-2 Rule Compliance
All dependencies within T04 satisfy the X-2 rule (skills can only depend on grades ≤ current grade or X-2).

**Example validation:**
- T04.G5.07 (grade 5) depends on:
  - T04.G5.01 (grade 5) ✓
  - T09.G3.01 (grade 3, within X-2) ✓

### ✓ Cross-Topic Dependencies Preserved
All dependencies to other topics remain intact:
- T01 (Everyday Algorithms): 3 dependencies
- T03 (Design Thinking): 1 dependency
- T06 (Script Building): 8 dependencies
- T07 (Loops): 9 dependencies
- T08 (Conditionals): 8 dependencies
- T09 (Variables): 11 dependencies

### ✓ No Circular Dependencies
Dependency graph remains acyclic with clear progression K→8.

### ✓ All CreatiCode Blocks Available
Verified all required blocks exist in CreatiCode platform (repeat, forever, custom blocks, variables, conditionals, lists).

- ❌ G5 bottleneck (all patterns depended on one G4 skill)
- ❌ Complex G7 skills with 4-5 tasks each
- ❌ Recognition-heavy, application-weak
- ❌ Template progression unclear
- ❌ Missing visual-to-code bridge

### After Optimization
- ✅ G2 purely conceptual/visual
- ✅ G4 counter pattern breaks bottleneck
- ✅ G7 skills scaffolded into sub-skills
- ✅ Application skills added in G5-G6
- ✅ Clear template progression G3→G6
- ✅ Explicit bridge at G3.08
