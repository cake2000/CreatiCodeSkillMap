# T36 – Careers, Collaboration & Future Paths: K–8 Skill List (Draft v4)

Topic reference: `T36 Careers & Collaboration` in `domains_topics_overview.md`
Domain: Computing & Society (D5) · CSTA focus: CAS‑CE, CAS‑ET, PRO‑PM (links to CAS‑HC, ALG‑IM, PRO‑PF)

Each skill below has:

- a stable **ID** (`T36.G<grade>.<nn>`),
- an IXL-style **short name**,
- a **description** (what understanding/behavior it targets),
- a **challenge format** (the typical problem type to assess it).

Where relevant, a primary **CSTA code** is noted.

**Role and scope in v3:** T36 builds students’ awareness of people, processes, and pathways in computing. K–2 activities stay concrete and social (spot tech in jobs, share devices kindly). Grades 3–5 expand to structured teamwork habits (empathy interviews, class roles, balanced tech routines) and exposure to diverse careers. Grades 6–8 transition to future-oriented exploration—career clusters, resume basics, mock interviews, and AI’s impact on work—while reinforcing collaboration norms needed across CreatiCode topics (T05 empathy, T24 XO policies, T32 security charters). Every skill ties directly to age-appropriate CSTA CAS‑CE/CAS‑ET/PRO‑PM outcomes.
