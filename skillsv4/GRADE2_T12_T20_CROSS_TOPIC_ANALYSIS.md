# Grade 2 Cross-Topic Dependency Analysis: Topics T12-T20

## Executive Summary

Analyzed all Grade 2 skills in topics T12-T20 (Documentation, Debugging, Games, Animation, UI, Motion, 3D, and Generative Art) to identify missing cross-topic dependencies. Found **13 conservative recommendations** that add foundational dependencies from core topics (T01-T08) to ensure proper skill progression.

## Analysis Scope

**Topics Analyzed:**
- T12 – Organizing Programs (Documentation)
- T13 – Testing, Debugging & Error Handling
- T14 – 2D Games
- T15 – Stories & Animation
- T16 – User Interfaces
- T17 – 2D Motion & Physics
- T18 – 3D Worlds & Games
- T20 – Algorithmic Art & Creative Coding

**Grade Level:** Grade 2 (G2) skills only

**Total G2 Skills Analyzed:** 24 skills across 8 topics

## Methodology

1. **Conservative Approach**: Only recommend truly necessary dependencies
2. **X-2 Rule Compliance**: All recommendations use prerequisites from grades K, 1, or 2
3. **Redundancy Check**: Avoided suggesting dependencies when similar concepts were already covered by existing dependencies
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identified five key cross-topic relationships:
   - **Sequencing** (T01) as foundation for organizing and documenting
   - **Conditionals** (T08) for game logic, debugging, and interactions
   - **Patterns** (T04) for animation, loops, and generative art
   - **Data Tracking** (T02) for game state management
   - **Spatial Reasoning** (T17) as foundation for 3D understanding

- **T17.G2.01**: Only has T17.G1.01 (within-topic progression is appropriate)
- **T20.G2.04**: Already has T01.G1.04, T20.G2.03 (prediction + pattern foundation)

## Validation

All recommended prerequisite skills were verified to:
1. ✅ Exist in the curriculum
2. ✅ Be at appropriate grade levels (K, 1, or 2)
3. ✅ Provide genuine conceptual foundation
4. ✅ Not duplicate existing dependencies

## Implementation Notes

**Conservative Philosophy**: These recommendations follow a conservative approach, only adding dependencies that provide clear conceptual prerequisites. Many skills were left unchanged because their existing dependencies adequately cover the necessary foundations.

**Pattern Recognition Skills Most Needed**: The most common missing dependency type was T04 (Algorithm Patterns), particularly for animation and generative art skills that involve repetition and symmetry.

**Conditional Logic Second Priority**: T08 (Conditions & Logic) dependencies were needed for skills involving interaction, state changes, and verification.
