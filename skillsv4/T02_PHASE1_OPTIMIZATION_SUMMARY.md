# T02 Algorithm Diagrams - Phase 1 Optimization Summary

## Overview

Topic T02 (Algorithm Diagrams) has been completely optimized and updated in `skillsv4/allskills.md`. This was a **major rewrite** that transformed the topic from abstract flowchart exercises to practical block-based coding using CreatiCode's actual features.

---

## Executive Summary

### The Core Problem
The original T02 skills were based on **features that don't exist in CreatiCode**:
- Specialized flowchart creation tools
- "Diagrams tab" in the interface
- Miro-powered whiteboard
- Diagram-to-code conversion features

### The Solution
Rewrote T02 to use **actual CreatiCode features**:
- Block-based coding environment
- Debug print blocks for algorithm tracing
- Breakpoint debugging (Grade 7+)
- Pseudocode generation block (control_get_script_from_sprite_block)
- Standard control flow blocks (if/else, loops)

## Recommendations for Teachers

### K-2: Continue Current Approach
- Use unplugged activities
- Picture-based sequencing exercises
- No platform changes needed

### Grades 3-5: Emphasize Hands-On Coding
- Students should build algorithms in CreatiCode
- Use debug print blocks extensively for tracing
- Focus on understanding HOW code executes
- Compare different solutions

### Grades 6-8: Bridge to Text-Based Thinking
- Introduce pseudocode generation in Grade 6

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Phase 1 focused ONLY on T02 internal quality. Phase 2 will handle:
- Cross-topic dependency validation
- Ensuring T02 skills align with skills from other topics
- Removing any remaining redundancies across topics
- Final coherence check across all topics

---

## Bottom Line

**Before:** T02 taught students to draw flowcharts using tools that don't exist.
**After:** T02 teaches students to build, trace, debug, and optimize algorithms using CreatiCode's actual block coding environment.

This transformation makes T02 **implementable, authentic, and pedagogically sound**.
