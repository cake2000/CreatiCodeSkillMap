# T27 – Data Analysis & Storytelling: K–8 Skill List (Draft v2)

Topic reference: `T27 Data Analysis` in `domains_topics_overview.md`
Domain: Data & Analysis (D3) · CSTA focus: DAA‑DP, DAA‑DI (links to PRO‑PF, CAS‑ET)

Each skill below has:

- a stable **ID** (`T27.G<grade>.<nn>`),
- an IXL-style **short name**,
- a **description** (what understanding/behavior it targets),
- a **challenge format** (the typical problem type to assess it).

Where relevant, a primary **CSTA code** is noted.

**Role and scope in v3:** T27 completes the T25→T26→T27 pipeline by turning collected, well-structured data into insights and stories. Grades K–2 interpret picture charts and notice simple patterns (no coding). Grades 3–5 build CreatiCode-powered charts (lists, tables, graph widgets) and justify claims using evidence. Grades 6–8 run comparative experiments, write queries, and communicate findings responsibly—including bias checks, dashboards, and decision memos used by AI-powered teams (T21–T24). Analysis is inseparable from storytelling: every skill requires interpreting patterns and communicating them clearly to peers or virtual assistants.
