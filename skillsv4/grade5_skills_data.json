The curve starts at (from x, from y) and ends at (to x, to y). Control points 1 and 2 shape the curve's bend - they act like invisible magnets pulling the curve toward them. To create a simple arc, place both control points above or below the line between start and end points. For S-curves, place control points on opposite sides. Experiment with control point positions to see how they affect curve shape. Curves are useful for smooth paths, decorative flourishes, or organic shapes.",

They experiment with mode settings: 'streaming' (updates variable with partial responses in real-time, ends with \u2705 emoji, good for showing progress) vs 'waiting' (waits for complete response before updating variable, better for processing complete answers). They use the length parameter to limit response size, learning that maximum tokens controls how long responses can be (100 tokens \u2248 75 words). They build projects comparing user experience between modes and appropriate length limits for different use cases.",
