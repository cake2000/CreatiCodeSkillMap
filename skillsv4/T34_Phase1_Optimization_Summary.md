# T34 (Computing History) Phase 1 Optimization Summary

## Overview

Topic T34 - Computing History has been comprehensively optimized to improve skill quality, add missing coverage, and fix structural issues.

## Before/After Comparison

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total Skills | 27 | 37 |
| Skills per Grade (avg) | 3 | 4.1 |
| New Skills Added | - | 10 |
| Skills Replaced | - | 1 |
| Skills Split | - | 3 |

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Critical Fixes

#### T34.G1.03 - REPLACED (Mismatched Title/Description)
- **Old:** "Explain how choosing different programming tools (blocks vs. text, 2D vs. 3D engine)..." - description talked about design choices, completely unrelated
- **New:** "Sort computing tools by era" - Students sort computing tools (abacus, calculator, computer, laptop, smartphone) into era categories, properly aligned with computing history theme

#### T34.GK.03 - Dependency Removed
- **Old:** Depended on T34.GK.01 (weak/unnecessary dependency)
- **New:** No dependencies - allows parallel teaching flexibility

#### T34.G3.03 - Dependency Fixed
- **Old:** Depended on T34.G3.02 (weak connection)
- **New:** Depends on T34.G2.03 (builds on biography skills - logical progression)

#### T34.G4.02 - Unnecessary Dependency Removed
- **Old:** Depended on T07.G2.01 (unrelated loop skill)
- **New:** Removed cross-topic dependency that made no sense for history topic

### 2. Overly Broad Skills - Split

#### T34.G6.01 - Split into 2 Focused Skills
**Original:** "Analyze major waves of computing (mainframe → personal computer → internet → mobile → AI)"
- Covered 5 eras + predictions in one skill - too broad

**Now:**
- **T34.G6.01:** "Analyze hardware computing eras (mainframe → PC → mobile)" - hardware focus
- **T34.G6.02:** "Analyze network computing eras (standalone → internet → cloud)" - network focus

#### T34.G6.02 (old) - Split into 2 Focused Skills
**Original:** Combined inclusion/exclusion analysis with UI evolution
**Now:**
- **T34.G6.03:** "Evaluate who had access to computing in different eras" - access barriers
- **T34.G6.04:** "Analyze how user interface evolution expanded access" - UI evolution

#### T34.G8.03 (old) - Split into 2 Skills
**Original:** Combined research gathering with presentation creation
**Now:**
- **T34.G8.03:** "Gather primary sources for computing history research"
- **T34.G8.04:** "Build an interactive CreatiCode exhibit about computing history"

### 3. Skills Moved/Reorganized

#### T34.G4.03 (old "Link hardware evolution to CreatiCode") → T34.G5.05
- Moved from Grade 4 to Grade 5
- Removed same-grade circular dependency (was depending on T34.G4.01)
- Now properly builds on G4 prerequisite skills

### 4. New Skills Added (Coverage Gaps Filled)

#### Software Evolution (Gap Fixed)
- **T34.G3.04:** "Trace software evolution from text to visual" - interface history

#### Gaming History (Gap Fixed)
- **T34.G3.05:** "Sequence gaming platform evolution" - arcade to VR history

#### Data Storage (Gap Fixed)
- **T34.G4.03:** "Trace data storage evolution" - punch cards to cloud

#### Internet History (Gap Fixed)
- **T34.G4.04:** "Sequence internet evolution milestones" - ARPANET to streaming
- **T34.G5.04:** "Analyze how internet changed communication" - social/economic impacts

#### Innovator Research Bridge (Gap Fixed)
- **T34.G4.05:** "Research an innovator's journey from idea to impact" - bridges G3.03 to G5.03

#### Pattern Analysis (Gap Fixed)
- **T34.G7.04:** "Analyze patterns of technological change" - miniaturization, cost reduction patterns

### 5. Titles/Descriptions Simplified

| Old Title | New Title |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Research 2-3 social movements where computing played a key role (e.g., civil rights data collection, open-source movement, accessibility advocacy) and present findings" | "Research a social movement where computing played a key role" |
| "Analyze historical computing failures (e.g., Therac-25, Y2K, failed AI systems) to identify lessons for preventing similar problems today" | "Analyze a historical computing failure" |
| "Create museum-style exhibits for innovators" | "Design a museum-style exhibit about a computing pioneer" |
| "Synthesize trends into future forecasts" | "Write evidence-based technology forecasts" |
| "Analyze cross-cultural innovation ecosystems" | "Analyze a cross-cultural innovation ecosystem" |
| "Produce primary-source research projects" | Split into two skills (see above) |
| "Compare regional computing histories" | "Compare regional computing adoption" |

### 6. Dependencies Updated Throughout File

All external references to T34 skills have been updated to use new skill names:
- Updated 2 references to old T34.G6.01 → new T34.G6.01

## Dependency Flow Improvements

### Before (Issues)
```
GK.01 → GK.03 (weak)
G3.01 → G3.02 → G3.03 (rigid linear chain)
G4.01 ← G4.03 (same-grade circular)
G3.01 ---gap--→ G5.02 (missing bridge)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
GK.01, GK.02, GK.03 (parallel options)
G3.01 → G3.02 (timeline path)
G2.03 → G3.03 (biography path - parallel)
G4.01 → G5.05 (proper grade progression)
G3.01 → G4.03/G4.04 → G5.04 (proper scaffolding)
```

## Quality Improvements

1. **Each skill now focuses on ONE concept** - no more multi-era or multi-topic combined skills
2. **Clear progression** from simple (identify) to complex (analyze patterns, create exhibits)
3. **Coverage gaps filled** - software, gaming, internet, data storage history now included
4. **All dependencies follow X-2 rule** - no skill depends on skills more than 2 grades back
5. **No same-grade internal dependencies** - proper ordering assumed within grade
6. **Simplified titles** - removed embedded examples from titles (moved to descriptions)
7. **Cross-topic dependencies preserved** - all T09, T10, T12, T13, T22, T33, T36 dependencies kept intact
