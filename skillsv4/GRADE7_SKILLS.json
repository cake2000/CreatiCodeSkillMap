When transitioning scenes, the SceneManager broadcasts: `broadcast (join [Scene] (currentScene))` and coordinates which sprites AND widgets appear or hide. Use `when green flag clicked` → `hide widget [button1 v]` to hide widgets from previous scenes, then `when I receive [Scene2]` → `show widget [button2 v]` to reveal widgets for the new scene. The SceneManager handles all scene transitions, widget visibility, background changes (`switch backdrop to [forest v]`), and story state tracking in one place. This architecture makes complex multi-scene stories easier to debug and expand.",

They learn the 3D coordinate system (x=right, y=up, z=forward/depth from camera) and identify all tracked body parts: head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, hips, knees, ankles, feet, plus detailed finger positions. They observe debug mode showing 3D skeleton visualization and understand how depth perception (z-axis) enables more sophisticated pose detection than 2D tracking.

They compare examples of blocks with clear, self-contained interfaces versus blocks that require users to know internal details (like specific variable names used inside). This \"information hiding\" principle makes code easier to use, understand, and modify, because changes to the internal implementation won't break code that calls the block.",

They understand that typical delays range from 20-200 milliseconds depending on distance and connection quality. They identify gameplay situations where delays cause problems: fast-paced action games (shooting, racing) are very sensitive to lag, while turn-based or slower games are more forgiving. They design gameplay mechanics that account for network delay: predictive movement (show where players will be), lag compensation (smooth interpolation), or turn-based actions (less affected by delay).
