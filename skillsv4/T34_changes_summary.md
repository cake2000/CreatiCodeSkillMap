# T34 (Computing History) - Changes Summary

## Overview

**Topic**: T34 – Computing History
**Total Skills**: 27 (current) → 28 (recommended) → 29 (with all optional)
**Grade Range**: K-8
**Status**: HIGH QUALITY - Minor optimizations needed

---

## Summary of Findings

### Strengths
- ✅ Excellent K→8 progression with appropriate complexity increase
- ✅ Strong diversity and inclusion focus (underrepresented innovators emphasized)
- ✅ Clean dependency structure (no forward references, all follow X-2 rule)
- ✅ Good balance of knowledge acquisition and creation/presentation activities
- ✅ Appropriate platform integration (CreatiCode mentioned but not required)
- ✅ K-2 skills properly unplugged/picture-based

### Issues Found
- ⚠️ 5 skill descriptions need improvement (vague or could be more actionable)
- ⚠️ 1 significant gap: programming language evolution not covered
- ⚠️ UI evolution only implicit, could be more explicit
- ⚠️ Minor: one skill uses passive verb ("learn from" vs "analyze")

### Overall Assessment
**GOOD** - Only minor improvements needed. No critical issues, no dependency violations, excellent scaffolding.

## Recommendations for Future

### Phase 2 Considerations
- Review T34 connections to T35 (Impacts & Ethics) - conceptual links exist
- Consider T34 ties to T31 (Networks) and T32 (Hardware) - historical context
- Maintain cross-topic dependencies to T01 (Sequencing), T03 (Decomposition)

### Teacher Resources
- Consider developing example timelines for teachers
- Provide diverse pioneer database (beyond examples in descriptions)
- Create rubrics for historical research projects
- Develop interview question guides for G5.03

### Platform Integration
- Interactive timeline templates in CreatiCode (support G3.01 extension)
- Presentation templates for pioneer biographies (support G7.03)
- Example projects showing history → modern feature connections
