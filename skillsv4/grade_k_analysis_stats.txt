==============================================
Date: 2025-11-24
Source: allskills.md

OVERVIEW
--------
Total Grade K Skills:        97
Topics with GK Coverage:     29 / 36 (81%)
Total Dependencies:          ~150+

CRITICAL CHECKS
---------------
✅ X-2 Rule Violations:      0 (PASS)
✅ Circular Dependencies:    0 (PASS)
✅ Invalid References:       0 (PASS)

OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
--------------------------
🟢 Redundant Dependencies:   7 (can be removed)
🟢 Missing Cross-Links:      4 (suggested additions)
🟢 Scaffolding Gaps:         2 (minor issues)
🟢 True Overlaps:            1 (pair to review)

TOPIC DISTRIBUTION
------------------
Highest GK Coverage:
  T01 (Everyday Algorithms)  - 8 skills
  T10 (Lists & Tables)       - 8 skills
  T14 (2D Games)             - 4 skills
  T04 (Algorithm Patterns)   - 4 skills

Most Depended Upon (Hub Skills):
  T01 - Depended upon by 11 topics
  T10 - Depended upon by 7 topics
  T04 - Depended upon by 4 topics
  T09 - Depended upon by 5 topics

No GK Coverage (7 topics):
  T07, T11, T12, T16, T17, T19, T28
  (Likely too advanced for kindergarten)

DEPENDENCY PATTERNS
-------------------
Foundational Skills (no dependencies): 24 skills (25%)
Skills with 1 dependency:              42 skills (43%)
Skills with 2 dependencies:            23 skills (24%)
Skills with 3+ dependencies:           8 skills (8%)

Longest Dependency Chains: ~4-5 levels deep

QUALITY METRICS
---------------
Structural Integrity:        100% (DAG, no cycles)
Grade Level Compliance:      100% (no X-2 violations)
Scaffolding Coverage:        98% (2 skills need review)
Graph Cleanliness:           93% (7 redundant deps)

IMPLEMENTATION EFFORT
---------------------
High Priority Fixes:         0 issues (none required!)
Medium Priority:             11 changes (optional)
Low Priority:                2 reviews (optional)

Estimated time for all:      ~40 minutes

CONCLUSION
----------
Grade K skills are READY FOR DEPLOYMENT.
All critical requirements met.
Optional optimizations available for refinement.
