## Changes Summary

### Dependency Fixes (4 changes)

1. **T10.G7.01** - Removed T07.G4.01 dependency (violated X-2 rule: G7 can't depend on G4)
2. **T10.G8.02** - Removed T01.G6.01 dependency (unnecessary cross-topic dependency)
3. **T10.G8.08** - Removed T01.G6.01 dependency (redundant with T09.G7.01)
4. **T10.G4.13** - Added T10.G4.12 dependency (split/join are inverse operations)

### Description Updates (2 changes)

5. **T10.G7.05** - Changed to "Clean and transform table data" (focuses on data transformation)
6. **T10.G7.06** - Changed to "Validate and handle missing data" (focuses on validation rules)

### New Skills (4 additions)

7. **T10.G3.09** - Display a list monitor on the stage (visual debugging)
8. **T10.G4.14** - Reverse the order of items in a list (CreatiCode reverse block)
9. **T10.G4.15** - Randomly shuffle items in a list (CreatiCode reshuffle block)
10. **T10.G5.11** - Insert a row at a specific position (parity with list insertion)

| 1     | 6      | 6     | 0      | Picture-based: tables, tally charts |
| 2     | 7      | 7     | 0      | Picture-based: understanding lists |
| 3     | 8      | 9     | +1     | Added list monitor (debugging) |
| 4     | 13     | 15    | +2     | Added reverse, shuffle |
| 5     | 10     | 11    | +1     | Added insert row at position |
| 6     | 7      | 7     | 0      | Advanced table operations |
| 7     | 10     | 10    | 0      | Data analysis & real-world apps |
| 8     | 8      | 8     | 0      | CS algorithms & data structures |
| **Total** | **77** | **81** | **+4** | |
