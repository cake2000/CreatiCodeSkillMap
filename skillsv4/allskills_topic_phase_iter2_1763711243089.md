Skill: Understand when to use custom blocks vs loops
Description: Students identify scenarios where a custom block is more appropriate than a loop. They recognize that loops repeat the SAME action multiple times, while custom blocks group a SEQUENCE of different actions for reuse. Given example scripts or problems, they choose the better organizational approach and explain their reasoning. This conceptual gateway skill builds organizational thinking without requiring students to define custom blocks yet.

Assessment example: Present 3-4 scenarios (e.g., "draw a house," "move 10 steps 5 times," "reset game state," "count to 10"). Students label each as better solved with a loop or a custom block and explain why.

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Identify parts of a script that could be helpers
Description: Students examine a longer script (15-30 blocks) and identify groups of blocks that represent distinct behaviors by drawing boxes around them and labeling each group with a descriptive name (e.g., "reset player," "check win condition," "show game over message").

Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand the concept of return values
Description: Students are introduced to the idea that a helper can **report** a value (as a reporter block/function) instead of just doing an action—e.g., a "Random Number Between [min] [max]" block returning a number or a "Distance to [sprite]" function in CreatiCode.

Skill: Describe what each helper does in a script
Description: Students read a script that uses several custom blocks and write a one-sentence description of each block's PURPOSE (e.g., "This block resets the player to the starting position and clears the score"). They focus on WHAT each block does (its goal), not HOW it does it (implementation details). They also identify how blocks fit together in the program's overall structure (e.g., setup, game loop, scoring, ending).

Skill: Design blocks with clear, predictable interfaces
Description: Students design custom blocks by first deciding what the block should do, what inputs (parameters) it needs, and what it should return (if anything) BEFORE writing the code inside.

ID: T11.G7.03
Topic: T11 – Functions & Procedures
Skill: Understand encapsulation and data hiding
Description: Students understand that a well-designed custom block acts like a "black box": users only need to know WHAT it does (its inputs and outputs), not HOW it does it (the code inside). They compare examples of blocks with clear interfaces versus blocks that require understanding internal variables or logic. This "hiding the complexity" principle (called encapsulation) makes code easier to use and change. This is a foundational concept in object-oriented programming.
