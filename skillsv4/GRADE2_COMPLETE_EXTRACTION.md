## Cross-Grade Dependencies

Many Grade 2 skills depend on Grade 1 (G1) skills, establishing a proper learning progression. Some notable cross-grade dependency patterns:

- **T01 (Algorithms)**: Heavy reliance on Grade 1 foundational skills
- **T14 (Game Mechanics)**: All 5 Grade 2 skills have Grade 1 dependencies
- **Most topics**: Show clear progression from Grade 1 to Grade 2
