# T06 Analysis Data - Incorrect Dependency References

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Incorrect Skill Titles in Dependencies

The following skills reference T06.G5.01 and/or T06.G5.02 with INCORRECT titles:

### Skills Referencing "T06.G5.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence"
(This is WRONG - should be "Identify standard event patterns in a small game")

## CORRECT SKILL DEFINITIONS (for reference)

T06.G5.01 (ACTUAL):
ID: T06.G5.01
Skill: Identify standard event patterns in a small game
Description: Students label patterns like "start game," "reset level," "on collision," "on score change" as specific event handlers in code.

T06.G5.02 (ACTUAL):
ID: T06.G5.02
Skill: Add a new event‑triggered behavior to an existing game
Description: Students add a new key or click event that triggers a simple new action without breaking existing ones.

## WHAT HAPPENED

This appears to be a systematic copy-paste error where:
1. Someone copied the dependency list template from earlier skills
2. The template had T06.G3.01 and T06.G3.02 dependencies
3. When creating dependencies for later skills, they changed the IDs (G3.01 → G5.01) but forgot to update the skill titles
4. This propagated across 44 different skills in multiple topics

---

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Within T06 Topic (3 skills affected):
- T06.G7.01, T06.G7.02, T06.G7.04
- These Grade 7 skills incorrectly show dependencies to "Build a green-flag script" instead of "Identify event patterns"
- This makes the dependency graph appear wrong (as if G7 skills only need basic G3 knowledge)

### Cross-Topic Impact (41 skills affected):
- Skills across 27 different topics have this error
- Most are Grade 5-7 skills depending on what they think is a basic skill but is actually an advanced pattern recognition skill
- This likely indicates these skills SHOULD depend on T06.G3.01 (basic green flag), not T06.G5.01 (pattern identification)

---

## RECOMMENDED FIX

### Option A: Update Dependency Titles (Cosmetic Fix)
Find and replace all instances:
- "T06.G5.01: Build a green‑flag script" → "T06.G5.01: Identify standard event patterns in a small game"
- "T06.G5.02: Build a key‑press script" → "T06.G5.02: Add a new event‑triggered behavior to an existing game"

Pros: Preserves current dependency structure
Cons: Doesn't fix potential logical error

### Option B: Review and Correct Dependencies (Logical Fix)
For each of the 44 affected skills:
1. Determine if they actually NEED event pattern identification (T06.G5.01)
2. OR if they only need basic event handling (T06.G3.01)
3. Update the dependency ID accordingly

Pros: Fixes underlying logical issues
Cons: Requires deep analysis of each skill

### RECOMMENDATION:
Start with Option A (cosmetic fix) for Phase 1, then review specific skills in Phase 2 when doing cross-topic optimization. Many of these skills likely DO need T06.G3.01 (basic events) rather than T06.G5.01 (advanced patterns).
