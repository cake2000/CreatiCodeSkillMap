* T10.G6.01: Sort a table by a column
* T08.G5.01: Use compound conditions with and/or/not


ID: T10.G7.08
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use regex patterns to find items in lists
Description: Students use regular expression patterns with `items in [list] matching pattern [regex]` to find items that match complex text patterns (e.g., "find all emails," "find all phone numbers," "find all codes starting with A").

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.08: Filter items from a list based on a condition
* T09.G6.02: Use text operations (join, split, substring, case conversion)


ID: T10.G7.09
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Connect to Google Sheets
Description: Students use CreatiCode's Google Sheets integration blocks to read data from and write data to Google Sheets, enabling cloud-based data storage and collaboration.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.02: Import external data into a table
* T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table


ID: T10.G7.10
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use AI to analyze table data
Description: Students use CreatiCode's AI blocks to ask questions about table data (e.g., "What are the key insights from this sales data?" or "Summarize the trends in this dataset"). They learn how AI can assist with data analysis.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.07: Analyze a dataset to find patterns or outliers
* T10.G5.08: Use built-in table aggregate blocks


ID: T10.G8.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use nested loops to compare data across two tables
Description: Students write nested loops to analyze relationships between two tables (e.g., matching orders to customers, finding common elements). The outer loop iterates through one table while the inner loop searches the other table for matches.

Dependencies:
* T07.G5.01: Use conditional loops for searching
* T10.G6.04: Use table lookup to find related data


ID: T10.G8.02
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement bubble sort algorithm step by step
Description: Students implement bubble sort by writing nested loops: the outer loop controls passes, the inner loop compares adjacent items and swaps if out of order. They trace through the algorithm to understand how items "bubble" to their correct positions.

Dependencies:
* T10.G4.10: Swap two items in a list
* T07.G6.01: Trace nested loops with variable bounds
* T01.G6.01: Count comparisons in linear and binary search


ID: T10.G8.03
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement selection sort algorithm step by step
Description: Students implement selection sort by writing nested loops: the outer loop selects each position, the inner loop finds the minimum remaining element. They understand that selection sort makes fewer swaps than bubble sort.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.02: Implement bubble sort algorithm step by step
* T10.G4.07: Find the maximum or minimum item in a list manually


ID: T10.G8.04
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Build a simulation using table-based state
Description: Students create a simulation (e.g., a game with multiple entities, a population model, an ecosystem) where entities and their properties are stored in a table. Each simulation step loops through rows to update values based on rules.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.03: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario
* T10.G5.07: Loop through table rows to compute aggregates
* T09.G6.01: Model real-world quantities using variables and formulas


ID: T10.G8.05
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Query and report statistics from a complex dataset
Description: Students work with a realistic multi-column table (e.g., weather data, sports statistics, survey results) and write code to answer analytical questions: compute means, find percentiles, compare groups, identify trends, and format results as a report.

Dependencies:
* T10.G7.07: Analyze a dataset to find patterns or outliers
* T10.G6.01: Sort a table by a column


ID: T10.G8.06
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Model relationships using multiple linked tables
Description: Students design and use multiple tables that reference each other (e.g., a Students table and a Grades table linked by student ID). They write code to perform lookups across tables to answer queries like "What are all grades for student X?"

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.01: Use nested loops to compare data across two tables
* T10.G7.03: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario


ID: T10.G8.07
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Implement a hash table lookup using lists
Description: Students simulate a simple hash table by using a list where each position corresponds to a hash value. They implement basic hash functions and handle collisions, understanding the performance benefits of constant-time lookup.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.03: Implement selection sort algorithm step by step
* T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches


ID: T10.G8.08
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Use advanced list operations for algorithm optimization
Description: Students apply advanced list techniques like binary search on sorted lists, two-pointer techniques, or sliding window algorithms to solve problems more efficiently than brute force approaches.

Dependencies:
* T10.G8.02: Implement bubble sort algorithm step by step
* T01.G6.01: Count comparisons in linear and binary search
* T09.G7.01: Compare computational efficiency of different approaches
