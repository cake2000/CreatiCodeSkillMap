VERB ANALYSIS (Top 15)
================================================================================
Use (14), Create (10), Build (10), Identify (9), Predict (8), 
Implement (7), Apply (7), Debug (6), Configure (6), Trace (5), 
Compare (5), Enable (3), Design (3), Control (3), Calculate (2)

ASSESSMENT: All verbs are specific and action-oriented. No vague verbs found.
Examples of strong verb usage:
- "Configure" instead of "use" or "understand"
- "Trace" instead of "learn about"  
- "Implement" instead of "create"
- "Debug" instead of "fix"

================================================================================
ISSUES & OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

STRENGTHS:
✓ No duplicate skill names found
✓ Strong verb usage (specific, measurable, action-oriented)
✓ Clear progression from picture-based (K-2) to advanced coding (G7-8)
✓ Dual track in G5 allows different learning paths
✓ Good balance of hands-on skills and computational thinking
✓ AI/ML integration in G8 is forward-thinking
✓ Sub-skills (.01, .02, etc.) provide depth without overwhelming main sequence

POTENTIAL CONCERNS:

1. HEAVY G5-G6 LOAD:
   - G5 has 30 skills, G6 has 31 skills (61 total = 43% of all T16 skills)
   - This could be overwhelming for students
   - Recommendation: Consider if some G6 skills could move to G7

2. GRADE GAP PATTERN:
   - K:6 → G1:5 → G2:8 → G3:5 → G4:8 (oscillating pattern)
   - Not necessarily a problem, but worth noting
   - May reflect natural topic pacing

3. SUB-SKILL DEPTH:
   - Some skills have 4+ sub-levels (e.g., T16.G5.06.00.01)
   - Deep hierarchies can be hard to navigate
   - But provide optional depth, which is valuable

4. CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCIES:
   - File notes "X-2 VIOLATION NOTE" for some G6-G7 skills
   - States these are "acceptable since cross-topic dependencies"
   - Dependencies on T07/T08/T09 from G3 create 3-4 grade gaps
   - Marked for Phase 2 optimization

5. MISSING PROGRESSION ELEMENTS:
   - No obvious gaps in skill progression
   - Each skill builds logically on prior skills
   - Dependencies appear well-structured

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. CONSIDER REDISTRIBUTING G5-G6 SKILLS:
   - Move 3-5 G6 skills to G7 to balance the load
   - Candidates: Advanced collision groups, performance optimization

2. TRACK STUDENT COMPLETION DATA:
   - Monitor if G5-G6 students complete all skills
   - High abandonment rate would indicate overload

3. PROVIDE LEARNING PATHS:
   - Create "core" vs "enrichment" designations
   - Let advanced students pursue sub-skills
   - Let struggling students focus on main skills only

4. ADDRESS X-2 VIOLATIONS IN PHASE 2:
   - As noted in file, cross-topic dependencies create gaps
   - Plan to revisit in cross-topic optimization phase

5. CONSIDER SKILL GROUPING:
   - Group related skills into mini-units (e.g., "Collision Detection Unit")
   - Makes navigation easier for teachers and students
