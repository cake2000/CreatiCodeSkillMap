## Age-Appropriateness Framework

**K-2**: Concrete "changing values" - score counters, visible changes. Manual counting before variables.

**3-5**: Formal variables with types. Expressions with operations. User input. State tracking.

**Issues Found**:
- 1 minor overlap: T09.G5.05 (lists) likely previews T10.G4.01
- **Resolution**: Acceptable - variables topic can introduce lists briefly

**No Dependency Errors**: ✓ All dependencies properly ordered

**Cross-Topic Dependencies**:

**Variables are depended upon by:**

- G2: Initialization, change by, timer
- G3: Types (number, text, boolean)
- G4: User input, loop counters, boolean state
- G5: Accumulators, strings, mod
- G6: Real-world modeling, intermediate results

**Dependency Density**:
- **Most depended-upon topic** in programming domain
- Almost every application skill G3+ depends on variables

**Recommendation**:
- **NO CHANGES NEEDED** - Excellent foundational topic
- Minor overlap with T10 is acceptable (preview vs deep dive)
- This is the variable "anchor" for all programming
