## Phase 1: High Priority Skills (19 skills)

### 1.1 K-2 Reasoning Skills (3 skills)
**Subtopic:** Representation & Reasoning - Binary Decision-Making
**AI4K12 Category:** B
**Topic Assignment:** T02 (Representing & Tracing Algorithms)

| Skill ID | Grade | Title | Key Concept |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| T02.GK.05 | K | Yes or No Game: Guess My Picture | Binary choice guessing game |
| T02.G1.05 | 1 | Follow the Yes/No Path to Choose | Follow decision tree |
| T02.G2.05 | 2 | Create a Yes/No Helper for Friends | Build simple decision tree |

**Rationale:** Placed in T02 (rather than T22) because these skills focus on representational thinking and algorithmic reasoning, which is T02's core focus. They build foundations for decision trees used later in chatbot logic (T22).

**Activity Types:**
- K: click_select (yes/no guessing)
- G1: click_path (follow tree)
- G2: build_tree (create tree)

---

### 1.2 K-2 Pattern Learning Skills (3 skills)
**Subtopic:** Machine Learning - How Computers Learn from Patterns
**AI4K12 Category:** C
**Topic Assignment:** T04 (Patterns & Abstraction)

## Dependency Strategy

### Principles Applied

1. **Build on existing foundations:** New K-2 skills use same picture-based formats
2. **Maintain grade progression:** Each grade builds on previous grade
3. **Cross-topic dependencies:** Allow dependencies across topics when logical
4. **Avoid circular dependencies:** Clear prerequisite chains verified

### Key Dependency Chains

#### Reasoning Chain (T02)
```

    → T02.G2.05 (create decision tree)
      → [connects to T22 chatbot logic skills]
```

#### Pattern Learning Chain (T04)
```
T04.GK.05 (sort patterns)
  → T04.G1.05 (teach with examples)
    → T04.G2.05 (more examples = better)
      → [connects to T21 AI training concepts]
```

#### Human Role Chain (T35 → T21)

    → T23.G2.01 (sensors provide info)
      → [connects to existing T23.G3+ vision/voice AI]
```

### Cross-Domain Dependencies

**New AI skills depend on existing skills:**
- T02 reasoning skills reference T01 (algorithms)
- T04 pattern skills build toward T21 (AI media), T25 (data)
- T24 ethical creation depends on T21 (understanding AI), T22 (building), T35 (impacts)

## Integration Notes

### Implementation Complexity: MEDIUM

**Easy Integration (K-2 skills):**
- Uses existing picture-based activity formats
- All activity types already supported by CreatiCode
- Main work: content creation (images, scenarios, feedback)

**Medium Integration (G3-8 skills):**
- Standard skill format (descriptions only)
- Requires lesson/project content development
- Some skills need templates (e.g., model card template for T24.G7-G8)

**No Platform Changes Required:**
- All activities use existing CreatiCode capabilities
- No new technology or features needed
- Ethical creation skills (T24) need documentation templates but not new code

### Content Development Needs

**Assets Required:**
1. **Images/Icons:** ~200 images for K-2 picture-based activities
2. **Templates:** Model card template, fairness checklist template
3. **Example Scenarios:** ~50 scenarios across all K-2 activities
4. **Audio:** TTS for all K-2 student prompts (auto-generated)
5. **Projects:** ~15 starter projects for G3-8 hands-on skills

**Estimated Development Time:**
- K-2 skills: 2-3 hours per skill × 16 = 32-48 hours
- G3-8 skills: 3-5 hours per skill × 15 = 45-75 hours
- **Total: 77-123 hours** (10-15 business days)
