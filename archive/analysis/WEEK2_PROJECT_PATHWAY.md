## Tips for Success

### For Students

**Planning:**
- Start early! Don't wait until the last minute
- Write down ALL your ideas before choosing one
- Ask real users what they need (not just what you think is cool)
- Keep it simple - better to do 3 features well than 10 poorly

**Building:**
- Code your must-have features FIRST
- Test as you build (don't wait until the end)
- Ask for help when stuck
- Save your work often!

**Testing:**
- Watch users test your app (don't explain - just watch!)
- Write down EVERYTHING they say and do
- Don't take feedback personally - it makes your app better
- Test with different people (not just friends)

**Presenting:**
- Practice your pitch 10+ times before presenting
- Time yourself - stay within time limits
- Make eye contact (if presenting live)
- Smile! You're proud of your work!

### For Teachers

**Time Management:**
- Build in extra time for debugging and iteration
- Schedule peer review days (students help each other)
- Use class time for presentations (save home time for coding)
- Create intermediate deadlines (not just final submission)

**Scaffolding:**
- Provide templates for all writing tasks
- Show example submissions (good and not-so-good)
- Use rubrics so students know expectations
- Allow revision and resubmission

**Support:**
- Help students choose realistic project scopes
- Connect students with mentors or experts
- Provide feedback early and often
- Celebrate all submissions (not just winners!)
