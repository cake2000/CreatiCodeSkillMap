GRADE 7-8 SKILLS: BEFORE/AFTER REVISION EXAMPLES
Specific recommendations for making skills age-appropriate
==========================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: Sorting Algorithm (T10.G8.02)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION (TOO ADVANCED):
Title: Implement a sorting algorithm (bubble sort or selection sort)
Activity: Students write code to implement bubble sort from scratch

WHY TOO ADVANCED:
- Requires understanding nested loops AND swap logic AND loop invariants
- Understanding WHY it works requires formal proof
- This is AP Computer Science A content (typically 11th-12th grade)

RECOMMENDED REVISION OPTION A (Move to enrichment):
Move to optional 'Competition Computing' enrichment track

RECOMMENDED REVISION OPTION B (Simplify for main track):
Title: Use sorting to organize data
Activity: Students use the built-in sort block to sort a list, then analyze
          'Does sorting by price give different results than sorting by name?'
Focus: Using sorting as a TOOL, not implementing the algorithm


EXAMPLE 2: Causal Relationships (T27.G8.02)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION (TOO ADVANCED):
Title: Analyze two variables for potential causal relationships
Activity: Students determine if X causes Y, identify confounding variables

WHY TOO ADVANCED:
- Causal inference is college-level statistics
- Requires understanding experimental design, controls, confounds
- AP Statistics content (11th-12th grade)

RECOMMENDED REVISION:
Title: Explore if two variables are related
Activity: Students look at two data columns and discuss:
  - 'When ice cream sales go up, drownings go up. Why might this be?'
  - 'Can you think of another explanation besides one causing the other?'
  - Introduction to 'just because things happen together doesn't mean one
    causes the other' WITHOUT formal causal inference terminology


EXAMPLE 3: Systemic Impacts (T35.G7.01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION (TOO ADVANCED):
Title: Analyze unintended systemic impacts of a technology
Activity: Map ripple effects and second-order consequences

WHY TOO ADVANCED:
- Systems thinking and second-order effects require abstract reasoning
- Typically high school social studies content
- 12-13 year olds can list effects but struggle with systemic connections

RECOMMENDED REVISION:
Title: What are the good and bad effects of a technology?
Activity: Students pick a technology (smartphones, social media, gaming) and:
  - List 3 ways it helps people
  - List 3 ways it might hurt people or cause problems
  - Discuss: 'Should we still use this technology? Why or why not?'
Focus: Direct effects students can observe, not systemic/ripple effects


EXAMPLE 4: Algorithm Complexity (T02.G7.03)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION (BORDERLINE):
Title: Analyze algorithm complexity and steps required
Activity: Students analyze algorithmic efficiency

WHY BORDERLINE:
- 'Complexity analysis' suggests Big-O notation (Algebra II/AP CS)
- Abstract efficiency reasoning is challenging for this age

RECOMMENDED REVISION:
Title: Count and compare steps in algorithms
Activity: Students are given two algorithms that solve the same problem:
  Algorithm A: Linear search through a list of 10 items
  Algorithm B: Check each item twice
  - 'Count how many steps each algorithm takes'
  - 'Which one is faster? Why?'
  - Then try with 100 items: 'What happens to the step count?'
Focus: CONCRETE counting, NOT Big-O or abstract complexity classes


EXAMPLE 5: Monte Carlo Simulation (T28.G7.02)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION (TERMINOLOGY ISSUE):
Title: Implement a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate a probability

WHY BORDERLINE:
- The CONCEPT is perfect for this age
- The TERM 'Monte Carlo' is intimidating and unnecessary

RECOMMENDED REVISION:
Title: Run many trials to estimate probability
Activity (same as before):
  - Roll a virtual die 1000 times
  - Count how many times you get a 6
  - Estimate: 'About how often does a 6 appear?'
Change: ONLY the terminology, the activity is already age-appropriate


EXAMPLE 6: Distribution Comparison (T27.G7.04)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION (BORDERLINE):
Title: Compare distributions of data
Short: Compare shape and spread of two datasets

WHY BORDERLINE:
- 'Distribution shape and spread' implies variance, skewness (Statistics)
- These are Algebra I or AP Statistics concepts

RECOMMENDED REVISION:
Title: Compare two datasets using averages and ranges
Activity: Students are given two datasets (e.g., Class A vs Class B test scores):
  - Calculate the average for each dataset
  - Find the highest and lowest values (range)
  - 'Which class did better on average?'
  - 'Which class had more spread out scores?'
Focus: Mean and range (6th-7th grade math) NOT distribution shape/variance


EXAMPLE 7: Pseudocode (T01.G7.03)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION (NEEDS SCAFFOLDING):
Title: Represent an algorithm in pseudocode or text code

WHY NEEDS SCAFFOLDING:
- 'Pseudocode' is unfamiliar term
- Students struggle to invent notation

RECOMMENDED REVISION:
Title: Plan an algorithm using words and simple steps
Activity: Provide heavy scaffolding:
  - Start with a working Scratch program
  - Provide a template: 'REPEAT ___ times: DO ___'
  - Students fill in the template to describe their algorithm
  - Example template:
    START
    SET score to 0
    REPEAT 10 times:
      IF player touches coin THEN
        ADD 1 to score
    END
Focus: Translation using templates, NOT inventing notation from scratch


EXAMPLE 8: Policy Analysis (T35.G8.02)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION (TOO FORMAL):
Title: Analyze policy and regulation of an emerging technology

WHY TOO ADVANCED:
- Policy analysis requires understanding government/regulatory systems
- Typically high school civics content

RECOMMENDED REVISION:
Title: Should there be rules about this technology?
Activity: Students discuss an emerging technology (AI, drones, etc.):
  - 'What could go wrong if there are no rules?'
  - 'What rule would you make?'
  - 'Who should enforce the rule? (parents, schools, government, companies?)'
  - Share ideas with class
Focus: Discussion and opinion, NOT formal policy analysis

POSITIVE EXAMPLES: SKILLS THAT ARE PERFECTLY AGE-APPROPRIATE
==========================================================================================

EXCELLENT EXAMPLE 1: Simulation Design (T05.G7.04)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Design a simulation for a real-world question

WHY EXCELLENT:
- Uses concrete, relatable scenarios
- Connects coding to science (simulations answer questions)
- Appropriate cognitive level: design, run, interpret
- Real examples: 'How does population grow with limited food?'

This is a MODEL of age-appropriate design:
- Concrete and visual (simulation)
- Real-world connection
- Appropriate complexity


EXCELLENT EXAMPLE 2: Real-World Data Modeling (T10.G7.01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Design and populate a table for a real-world inventory or database

WHY EXCELLENT:
- Practical life skill (organizing data)
- Concrete examples: library catalog, game inventory, sports stats
- Appropriate cognitive level for 12-13 year olds
- Connects to real-world database concepts without being too technical


EXCELLENT EXAMPLE 3: Data Quality (T26.G7.04)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Identify and correct data quality issues
Short: Debug and repair data

WHY EXCELLENT:
- Debugging is core CS skill
- Data quality is highly relevant and practical
- Concrete issues: duplicates, out-of-range values, missing entries
- Appropriate terminology and expectations
- Real-world relevance


==========================================================================================
KEY TAKEAWAYS
==========================================================================================

PATTERNS IN TOO-ADVANCED SKILLS:
1. Use formal/technical terminology (Monte Carlo, pseudocode, systemic)
2. Require abstract reasoning beyond concrete examples
3. Expect analysis/proof rather than exploration/discussion
4. Cover college or AP-level content

PATTERNS IN WELL-DESIGNED SKILLS:
1. Use accessible, descriptive language
2. Provide concrete examples and scenarios
3. Focus on exploration, creation, and discussion
4. Connect to real-world applications students care about
5. Match 6th-8th grade math/science expectations

QUICK FIX CHECKLIST:
[ ] Replace technical jargon with descriptive terms
[ ] Change 'analyze' to 'explore' or 'compare' where appropriate
[ ] Change 'prove' to 'test' or 'try'
[ ] Use concrete numbers instead of abstract complexity
[ ] Provide templates and scaffolding for new skills
[ ] Focus on 'what' and 'how' rather than 'why' for theoretical concepts
