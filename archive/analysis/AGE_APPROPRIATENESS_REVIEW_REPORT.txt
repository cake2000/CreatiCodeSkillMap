==========================================================================================
CATEGORY 1: DEFINITELY TOO ADVANCED (Move or Drastically Simplify)
==========================================================================================

1. [T10.G8.02] Grade 8 - T10
   TITLE: Implement a sorting algorithm (bubble sort or selection sort)
   SHORT: Write a sorting algorithm

   WHY TOO ADVANCED:
   - Cognitive: Very High - Requires understanding nested loops AND swap logic
   - Prerequisites: Sorting algorithms are AP CS A content (typically grade 11-12)
   - Topic Maturity: Too advanced algorithmically

   RECOMMENDATION: MOVE TO ENRICHMENT: This is competition math/CS Olympiad content for 8th grade

   JUSTIFICATION: While bright students can implement bubble sort, understanding WHY it works requires formal reasoning

   CHALLENGING ASPECTS:
   - Proving correctness
   - Understanding invariants
   - Analyzing efficiency

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. [T27.G8.02] Grade 8 - T27
   TITLE: Analyze two variables for potential causal relationships
   SHORT: Explore whether one variable affects another

   WHY TOO ADVANCED:
   - Cognitive: Very High - Causal inference is college-level statistics
   - Prerequisites: Correlation vs causation is AP Statistics content (grade 11-12)
   - Topic Maturity: Too advanced statistically

   RECOMMENDATION: SIMPLIFY DRASTICALLY: Discuss "Ice cream sales and drowning both go up in summer - why?" NOT formal causal analysis

   JUSTIFICATION: True causal inference requires understanding confounds, experimentation, and is beyond K-8

   CHALLENGING ASPECTS:
   - Identifying confounding variables
   - Understanding experimental design requirements
   - Formal hypothesis testing

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. [T35.G7.01] Grade 7 - T35
   TITLE: Analyze unintended systemic impacts of a technology
   SHORT: How does one technology change everything?

   WHY TOO ADVANCED:
   - Cognitive: Very High - Systems thinking and second-order effects
   - Prerequisites: Systemic analysis is typically high school social studies
   - Topic Maturity: Too advanced for formal analysis

   RECOMMENDATION: SIMPLIFY: "Name 3 good things and 3 bad things about smartphones" NOT systemic ripple effects

   JUSTIFICATION: 12-13 year olds can list pros/cons but systemic/second-order thinking develops later

   CHALLENGING ASPECTS:
   - Second-order effects
   - Unintended consequences
   - System-level thinking

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


==========================================================================================
CATEGORY 2: BORDERLINE (Teachable with Proper Scaffolding)
==========================================================================================

1. [T02.G7.03] Grade 7 - T02
   TITLE: Analyze algorithm complexity and steps required

   COGNITIVE LEVEL: Formal Operations (Piaget) - abstract reasoning about efficiency
   RECOMMENDATION: SIMPLIFY: Focus on concrete counting (this takes 10 steps, this takes 100), not formal complexity
   WHY: 12-13 year olds can compare concrete quantities but formal algorithm analysis is typically 15+

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. [T01.G8.02] Grade 8 - T01
   TITLE: Understand recursion conceptually (algorithm calling itself)

   COGNITIVE LEVEL: High - Recursion requires mental stack management
   RECOMMENDATION: KEEP WITH SUPPORT: Use visual recursion (fractals, nested patterns) NOT code recursion
   WHY: Conceptual recursion (Russian dolls, fractals) is accessible; implementing recursion is not

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. [T01.G7.03] Grade 7 - T01
   TITLE: Represent an algorithm in pseudocode or text code

   COGNITIVE LEVEL: Medium-High - Pseudocode requires abstraction from concrete code
   RECOMMENDATION: KEEP WITH SCAFFOLDING: Provide templates, focus on translating Scratch to text
   WHY: Pseudocode is valuable but needs heavy scaffolding at this age

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. [T27.G7.04] Grade 7 - T27
   TITLE: Compare distributions of data

   COGNITIVE LEVEL: Medium-High - Distribution comparison requires statistical thinking
   RECOMMENDATION: SIMPLIFY: Compare using mean and range, NOT shape and spread
   WHY: Comparing averages is age-appropriate; discussing skew and variance is not

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. [T28.G7.02] Grade 7 - T28
   TITLE: Implement a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate a probability

   COGNITIVE LEVEL: Medium - Simulation is accessible, "Monte Carlo" term is not
   RECOMMENDATION: KEEP BUT RENAME: Call it "Run Many Trials to Estimate Probability"
   WHY: Running 1000 dice rolls to estimate probability is perfect for this age. "Monte Carlo" scares them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. [T26.G8.03] Grade 8 - T26
   TITLE: Analyze relationships between variables in data

   COGNITIVE LEVEL: Medium-High - Analyzing variable relationships
   RECOMMENDATION: CLARIFY: "Look for patterns" YES, "calculate correlation" NO
   WHY: Exploring "when X is high, is Y high?" is fine. Correlation coefficients are not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. [T35.G8.02] Grade 8 - T35
   TITLE: Analyze policy and regulation of an emerging technology

   COGNITIVE LEVEL: High - Policy analysis requires understanding government systems
   RECOMMENDATION: SIMPLIFY: "Should there be rules about this?" NOT policy analysis
   WHY: Discussion of rules is appropriate; formal policy evaluation is not

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. [T28.G8.03] Grade 8 - T28
   TITLE: Analyze bias in AI models trained on biased data

   COGNITIVE LEVEL: Medium-High - Understanding bias in AI models
   RECOMMENDATION: KEEP WITH SUPPORT: Use concrete examples, avoid technical ML details
   WHY: AI bias is crucial for digital citizenship, but keep it accessible

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. [T28.G7.01] Grade 7 - T28
   TITLE: Conduct a full multi-step experiment with hypothesis
   SHORT: Test a hypothesis with an experiment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. [T04.G8.02] Grade 8 - T04
   TITLE: Design modular, reusable custom blocks for a project
   SHORT: Build a library of procedures for a project

   DESCRIPTION: Students design and build a suite of well‑named, well‑documented custom blocks (procedures) for a project, recognizing that good abstractions make code easier to reason about, test, and reuse across multiple scenes or game states.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. [T26.G8.02] Grade 8 - T26
   TITLE: Execute a complete data investigation (question to analysis)
   SHORT: Conduct a full data investigation

==========================================================================================
GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR AGE-APPROPRIATE DESIGN
==========================================================================================

Based on this review, here are key principles for 'IXL for coding' quality:

1. CONCRETE BEFORE ABSTRACT
   - Show 'this loop takes 10 steps, this takes 100' NOT 'this is O(n), this is O(n^2)'
   - Use real counts, real data, real scenarios

2. ACCESSIBLE TERMINOLOGY
   - 'Plan in words' > 'Pseudocode'
   - 'Run many trials' > 'Monte Carlo simulation'
   - 'Compare averages' > 'Compare distributions'
   - 'Are X and Y related?' > 'Causal relationship analysis'

3. DISCUSSION NOT FORMAL ANALYSIS
   - For ethics/society: 'What are pros and cons?' YES, 'Analyze systemic impacts' NO
   - For data: 'Do these seem related?' YES, 'Causal inference' NO
   - For algorithms: 'Count the steps' YES, 'Big-O notation' NO

4. VISUAL AND INTERACTIVE
   - Flowcharts before text
   - Simulations and games as contexts
   - Hands-on data collection
   - Concrete manipulatives and examples

5. AGE-APPROPRIATE COGNITIVE EXPECTATIONS
   - 12-14 year olds CAN: compare, describe patterns, debug, discuss pros/cons, collect data
   - 12-14 year olds STRUGGLE with: formal analysis, systems thinking, abstract efficiency,
     causal inference, policy analysis, proving correctness

==========================================================================================
CONCLUSION
==========================================================================================

Overall, the CreatiCode Grade 7-8 skill map is STRONG with age-appropriate content
in most areas. The main issues are:

1. A few skills use overly technical terminology that can be simplified
   (Monte Carlo, pseudocode, distributions)

2. Three skills venture into college-level concepts and need major revision:
   - Sorting algorithms implementation (move to enrichment)
   - Causal relationship analysis (simplify to correlation exploration)
   - Systemic impact analysis (simplify to pros/cons listing)

3. Several borderline skills are appropriate WITH proper scaffolding:
   - Recursion (keep conceptual/visual)
   - Algorithm efficiency (count steps, not Big-O)
   - Data analysis (exploratory, not formal statistics)

STRENGTHS:
- Excellent use of simulations and real-world contexts
- Strong emphasis on debugging and testing
- Good progression of pattern recognition skills
- Relevant and timely ethics/AI topics

With the recommended revisions, this skill map will achieve 'IXL for coding' quality
with perfect age-appropriateness for 12-14 year olds.
