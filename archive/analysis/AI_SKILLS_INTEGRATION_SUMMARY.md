## Integration into Complete K-8 Map

### How to Merge New Skills

**To integrate into `skills_complete_k8.json`:**

1. **Locate insertion points** in existing file:
   - Find last skill for each grade/topic combination
   - Insert new skills after existing skills in same grade/topic

2. **Maintain ID order**:
   - Within each topic, skills should be ordered: GK.01, GK.02... G1.01, G1.02... G8.XX
   - New .05 and .06 series fit after existing .01-.04

3. **Verify dependencies**:
   - Ensure all referenced skill IDs exist
   - Check that no circular dependencies created

4. **Update counts**:
   - Update topic skill counts in metadata
   - Update total AI skill count (166 → 197)

**Example insertion for T02:**
```json
{existing T02.GK.01-04 skills},
{NEW: T02.GK.05},
{NEW: T02.GK.06},
{existing T02.G1.01-04 skills},
{NEW: T02.G1.05},
{NEW: T02.G1.06},
...
```
