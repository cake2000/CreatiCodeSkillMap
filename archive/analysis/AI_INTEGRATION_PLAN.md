---

## Dependency Strategy

### Principles
1. **Build on existing skills** - New K-2 skills use same formats as existing (picture-based)
2. **Maintain progression** - Each new skill builds on prior grade skills
3. **Cross-topic dependencies** - AI skills can depend on non-AI topics (e.g., T01-T02)
4. **Avoid circular dependencies** - Clear prerequisite chains

### Key Dependency Chains

**Reasoning Chain:**
```
T22.GK.01 (yes/no game) 
  → T22.G1.01 (follow decision tree) 
    → T22.G2.01 (create decision tree)
      → T22.G3.01+ (existing chatbot skills)
```

**Pattern Learning Chain:**
```
T21.GK.01 (sort patterns)
  → T21.G1.01 (teach with examples)
    → T21.G2.02 (more examples better)
      → T21.G3.02+ (existing training data skills)
```

**Human Role Chain:**
```
T35.GK.05 (who makes AI)
  → T35.G1.05 (people build AI)
    → T35.G2.05 (humans train AI)
      → T21.G3.05 (AI team roles)
        → T21.G4-8.05 (data curation, labeling, planning)
```

**Ethical Creation Chain:**
```
T24.G3.05 (design for everyone)
  → T24.G4.05 (fairness checklist)
    → T24.G5.05 (ethical design)
      → T24.G6.05 (build and test)
        → T24.G7.05 (simple model card)
          → T24.G8.05 (full documentation)
```

### Cross-Domain Dependencies

**New AI skills depend on existing skills:**
- T22.GK-G2 (reasoning) can reference T01 (algorithms, sequencing)
- T02 representation skills support T21-T23 (AI representation needs)
- T24 ethical creation depends on T21 (bias), T22 (building), T35 (impacts)

---

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Month 1-2): Critical Foundation
1. **T22.GK-G2.01** - K-2 reasoning (3 skills) - Easy to implement, high impact
2. **T21.GK-G2** - K-2 pattern learning (3 skills) - Easy to implement, high impact

**Rationale:** These 6 skills are low-effort and provide K-2 foundation for all later AI learning

### Short-term (Month 3-4): Human Understanding
3. **T35.GK-G2.05** - K-2 human role (3 skills)
4. **T21.G3-8.05** - G3-8 human role (6 skills)

**Rationale:** Addresses highest-priority gap across all grades

### Medium-term (Month 5-6): Ethical Creation
5. **T24.G3-8.05** - Ethical creation (6 skills)

**Rationale:** Completes highest-priority gaps, builds on earlier skills

### Phase 2 (Month 7-12): Complete Coverage
6. **T23.GK-G2** - K-2 sensing (3 skills)
7. **T02.GK-G8.05** - Representation skills (7-10 skills)

**Rationale:** Medium-priority items, complete AI4K12 alignment

---

## New Topics Assessment

### Recommendation: NO NEW TOPICS NEEDED

**Rationale:**
- All new skills fit within existing topic framework
- T21-T24 are broad enough to accommodate additions
- T35-T36 cover societal/ethical aspects
- T02 (non-AI topic) provides foundation for representation

**Alternative Consideration:**
If the number of skills in T21 becomes unwieldy (currently 25, would add ~10 → 35), could create:

**T21A: Understanding AI Models** (optional split)
- Focus on how AI works, human roles, training data
- K-8 coverage

**T21B: Creating with AI** (optional split)
- Focus on using AI generation tools
- G2-8 coverage (as currently exists)

**Decision:** Recommend DEFER this split until seeing if T21 with 35 skills feels too crowded.

---

## CSTA Standards Alignment

### New Skills Should Map To:

**K-2 Skills:**
- **1A-IC-17:** Students can identify computing technologies that have changed the world
- **1A-AP-08:** Students can model daily processes by creating and following algorithms

**Grades 3-5:**
- **1B-IC-18:** Discuss computing technologies that have changed the world
- **1B-AP-10:** Create programs including sequences, events, loops, conditionals

## Integration Complexity Assessment

### Low Complexity (Easy Integration)
- **K-2 reasoning skills (T22)** - Uses existing picture-based format
- **K-2 pattern learning (T21)** - Uses existing sorting/selection format
- **K-2 sensing (T23)** - Uses existing matching format

### Medium Complexity (Requires Some Development)
- **Human role skills** - Requires new content/examples but standard format
- **Representation skills (T02)** - May require new activity types (drawing, mapping)

### Medium-High Complexity (More Development)
- **Ethical creation skills** - Requires model card templates, ethical frameworks
- **Grade 8 feature vectors** - Requires more advanced AI/data representation

### Overall Assessment: **MEDIUM**

**Rationale:**
- Most skills use existing activity formats
- Platform already supports needed interactions
- Main work is content development and learning design, not new platform features
- Ethical creation requires some new templates but not new technology
