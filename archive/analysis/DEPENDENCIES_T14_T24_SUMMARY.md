## Cross-Application Patterns

### Game Development Ecosystem (T14, T17, T18, T19)

These topics share common patterns:
- Event-driven interaction (T06)
- Game loop patterns (T07)
- State management (T08, T09)
- Multiplayer data structures (T10)

### Media & Creative (T15, T20, T21)

Common dependencies:
- Animation loops (T07)
- Parameter control (T09)
- Scene management (T12)
- AI integration for asset generation (T21)

### Interface & Interaction (T16, T22, T23)

Shared patterns:
- User input handling (T06, T09)
- Validation logic (T08)
- Data display (T10)
- Accessibility considerations (T05)

### AI & Ethics (T21, T22, T23, T24)

All AI topics depend on:
- Human-Centered Design principles (T05)
- API integration patterns (T06, T09)
- Ethical considerations (T05, T35)

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- ✓ All skills have clear learning pathways
- ✓ No grade-level conflicts detected
- ✓ Strong integration with programming core (T06-T13)
- ✓ Progressive complexity from G1 to G8
- ✓ High number of capstone skills for assessment

### Areas for Consideration
- Early grades (1-2) have minimal dependencies - appropriate for introduction
- Heavy reliance on T06 (Events) and T07 (Loops) - indicates event-driven programming model
- T24 (XO) has unique pattern as meta-level skill

## Recommendations

### For Curriculum Design
1. **Ensure Programming Core Mastery:** Students must achieve proficiency in T06-T13 before tackling application topics
2. **Sequential Introduction:** Introduce T14 (2D Games) before T18 (3D Games), T15 (Stories) before T21 (AI Media)
3. **Capstone Projects:** Use identified capstone skills as end-of-unit assessments
4. **Cross-Domain Integration:** Design projects that combine multiple application domains (e.g., game + AI)

### For Assessment
1. Use capstone skills (5+ deps) as performance assessments
2. Focus on integration of T06-T13 skills in context
3. Assess problem decomposition (T03) in project planning
4. Evaluate ethical considerations (T05) for AI projects

### For Teaching Sequence
1. **Grades 3-4:** Focus on simple applications with clear dependencies
2. **Grades 5-6:** Introduce cross-topic integration and capstone projects
3. **Grades 7-8:** Advanced integration, AI topics, and meta-level skills (T24)

## Next Steps

1. Review and validate dependency assignments with subject matter experts
2. Create sample capstone projects for each major topic
3. Develop rubrics for assessing multi-dependency skills
4. Map to CSTA standards and learning objectives
5. Create teacher guides for cross-topic integration
