## Actionable Insights

### For Curriculum Designers

1. **Grade 3 is critical**: Plan intensive integration at this level
2. **Applications need programming foundation**: Ensure T06-T09 mastery before applications
3. **Data requires programming**: Students need Variables, Lists, Loops for data work
4. **Advanced work is complex**: Grades 6-8 require 5-6+ prerequisite skills

### For Teachers

1. **Check prerequisites**: Use dependency chains for readiness assessment
2. **Plan spiraling**: Foundational topics (T06-T09) recur across applications
3. **Integration milestones**: Grade 3, Grade 6 are key integration points
4. **Project planning**: Advanced projects need 6+ prerequisite skills

### For Students

1. **Learning pathways**: Dependencies show what to learn first
2. **Progress tracking**: Can see prerequisite completion
3. **Challenge readiness**: Dependency count indicates complexity
4. **Skill connections**: Understand how concepts relate
