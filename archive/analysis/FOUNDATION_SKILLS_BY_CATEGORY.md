**Grade 2 (6-8 skills):**
1. Move and Turn Basics
2. Say and Think Bubbles
3. Play a Sound
4. Switch Costumes
5. Show and Hide
6. Change Size
7. Detect Touch and Clicks
8. Simple Sensing (key pressed, mouse position)

**Grade 3 (9-12 skills):**
1. Glide to Position
2. Go to Location (sprite, mouse, x/y)
3. Point in Direction
4. Change/Set X and Y
5. Graphic Effects (color, ghost, brightness)
6. Sound Volume and Tempo
7. Ask and Answer
8. Distance Sensing
9. Pen Basics (if needed)
10. Stamp and Clear (if needed)
11. Random Numbers
12. Math Functions (round, abs)

### Priority 2: ENHANCEMENTS (Optional)
- Add more advanced motion (bounce on edge)
- Layer ordering (front/back)
- Advanced effects (fisheye, whirl, mosaic)
- MIDI/music blocks (play note, drum, tempo)
- Advanced sensing (timer, loudness)

### Integration Strategy:
1. Create new topic **T37: CreatiCode Block Basics** OR
2. Expand T01 (Algorithms) to include more foundational blocks
3. Make these skills prerequisites for T14-T20 (project-based topics)
4. Ensure T01.G3.01 is enhanced or supplemented with block tutorials

---

## CONCLUSION

**What's EXCELLENT:**
- 78 skills teaching computational thinking concepts (Events, Loops, Conditionals, Variables, Lists, Functions)
- Progressive skill development across grades
- Rich project-based learning opportunities

**What's MISSING:**
- Systematic teaching of CreatiCode block palette
- Only 13 skills cover basic blocks (mostly operators)
- Students expected to learn Motion/Looks/Sound/Sensing/Pen through osmosis

**Action Required:**
Add 15-20 foundational block skills to Grades 2-3 to ensure students can confidently use all CreatiCode blocks before tackling advanced projects.
