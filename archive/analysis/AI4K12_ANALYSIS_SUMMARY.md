- Strengthens abstraction and representation understanding

---

## Integration Strategy

### No New Topics Needed
All new skills fit within existing framework:
- **T21 (AI Media):** +10-12 skills (pattern learning, human role)
- **T22 (Chatbots):** +3 skills (K-2 reasoning)
- **T23 (Multimodal):** +3 skills (K-2 sensing)
- **T24 (AI Coding):** +6 skills (ethical creation)
- **T35 (Impacts):** +3 skills (K-2 human role) - optional
- **T02 (Representing):** +7-10 skills (representation) - extends non-AI topic

### Implementation Complexity: MEDIUM
- **Low:** K-2 skills use existing picture-based formats
- **Medium:** Human role skills need new content but standard format
- **Medium-High:** Ethical creation needs model card templates

### Dependencies Well-Structured
- New skills build on existing skills
- Clear prerequisite chains
- No circular dependencies
- Cross-topic integration (T01, T02 foundational for AI topics)

### Quantitative
- **29-35 new skills** added
- **AI4K12 alignment: 75% → 95%+**
- **K-2 coverage tripled** (8 → 23-26 skills)
