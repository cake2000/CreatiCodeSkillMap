## Foundational Skills (Entry Points)

Every topic has exactly one Grade 1 foundational skill with no prerequisites:

1. **T01.G1.01**: Write or draw steps for a simple task
2. **T02.G1.01**: Create an algorithm in pictures and words
3. **T03.G1.01**: Explain what one part of a system does
4. **T04.G1.01**: Find repeated blocks in a script
5. **T05.G1.01**: Ask what someone needs

## Cross-Topic Integration Patterns

### Primary Integration Pathways

1. **T01 ↔ T02** (15 connections): Algorithms and their representation in code
2. **T01 ↔ T03** (9 connections): Algorithms and problem decomposition
3. **T03 ↔ T05** (8 connections): Decomposition supports design thinking
4. **T04 ↔ T01** (5 connections): Patterns inform algorithm design

### Integration by Grade Band

- **Grades 1-2**: 2-3 cross-topic dependencies (foundational isolation)
- **Grades 3-4**: 8-10 cross-topic dependencies (initial integration)
- **Grades 5-6**: 12-14 cross-topic dependencies (strengthening connections)
- **Grades 7-8**: 15-17 cross-topic dependencies (mature synthesis)

## Grade 8 Capstone Examples

Each topic culminates in a sophisticated Grade 8 skill:

- **T01.G8.04**: Refactor a complex algorithm for clarity or efficiency
  - Deps: T01.G8.02, T03.G8.01

- **T02.G8.04**: Compare deterministic and probabilistic algorithms
  - Deps: T02.G8.03, T01.G8.02

- **T03.G8.04**: Refactor a large codebase into modules
  - Deps: T03.G8.03, T01.G8.02

- **T04.G8.04**: Analyze and justify choices in pattern-based design
  - Deps: T04.G8.03, T03.G8.02

- **T05.G8.04**: Evaluate realism and limitations in a simulation
  - Deps: T05.G8.03, T03.G8.02

## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **Zero Grade-Level Conflicts**: All dependencies respect grade progression
2. **Balanced Complexity**: 1.24 avg dependencies prevents over-specification
3. **Clear Entry Points**: Each topic has a G1 foundational skill
4. **Logical Progression**: Skills build vertically within topics
5. **Meaningful Integration**: Cross-topic dependencies reflect natural relationships

### Dependency Patterns

1. **Minimal Early Dependencies**: Grades 1-2 focus on within-topic foundations
2. **Emerging Integration**: Grades 3-4 introduce cross-topic connections
3. **Strengthening Synthesis**: Grades 5-6 build multi-topic competencies
4. **Advanced Integration**: Grades 7-8 combine concepts across domains

### Quality Assessment

- **No Circular Dependencies**: Clean dependency graph
- **No Forward References**: No skill depends on higher-grade skills
- **Appropriate Specificity**: Dependencies are direct, not transitive
- **Pedagogically Sound**: Reflects natural learning progressions

## Use Cases

### For Curriculum Design
- Use dependency chains to sequence lessons
- Identify prerequisite knowledge for each unit
- Design scaffolded learning experiences

### For Assessment
- Check prerequisites before advancing students
- Design formative assessments around dependency chains
- Create remediation pathways using dependency graph

### For Platform Implementation
- Lock skills until prerequisites completed
- Generate recommended learning paths
- Visualize student progress through dependency trees
- Provide adaptive skill recommendations
