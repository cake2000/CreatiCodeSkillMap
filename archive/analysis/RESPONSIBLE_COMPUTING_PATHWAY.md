## Integration Points

### With Programming Core (T06-T13)
- T32 connections to T09 (variables/passwords)
- T33 connections to T06-T11 (APIs require programming)
- T36 connections to T12 (code style/ethics)

### With AI Topics (T21-T24)
- T35 understanding of AI impacts
- T36 ethical implications of AI
- Combined bias analysis (T28.G8.03 + T35.G7.01)

### With Human-Centered Design (T05)
- T30 design thinking for hardware/software
- T32 user security awareness
- T34 historical perspectives on user needs
- T35 impact on human experience
- T36 collaborative problem-solving

## Capstone Integration

**Final Synthesis (Grade 8)**:
- T32.G8.* Advanced cybersecurity concepts with T35/T36 ethics
- T35.G8.01 Systemic impact synthesis across applications
- T36.G8.01 Complete responsible computing integration

Students completing this pathway understand:
1. Technical security foundations
2. Societal impacts of computing
3. Ethical decision-making frameworks
4. Professional responsibility
5. Collaborative, inclusive practices
