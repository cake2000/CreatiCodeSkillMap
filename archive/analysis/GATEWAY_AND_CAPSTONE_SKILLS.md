# Gateway and Capstone Skills: High-Leverage Skills Map

**Identify the most important skills that unlock learning and integrate advanced knowledge**

---

## Overview

Not all 1,155 skills have equal impact. Some skills are **gateways** - they enable many other skills to be learned. Others are **capstone** skills - they require many prerequisites and integrate advanced knowledge.

This document helps you:
- Identify which skills to emphasize for maximum impact
- Ensure students don't skip critical foundations
- Recognize when students are ready for advanced topics

### How to Use Gateway Skills

#### Strategy 1: Universal Emphasis
Ensure that 95%+ of all students achieve these 27 skills.

```
Teaching Plan:
- Build in extra practice time for gateway skills
- Use multiple representations and examples
- Provide intervention for students struggling
- Verify mastery before moving forward
```

#### Strategy 2: Prerequisite Checking
Before assigning a skill, check its gateway prerequisites.

```
Example: Can a student attempt T14.G5.01 (game with multiple states)?
Check: Does the student have these gateway skills?
  - T08.G3.01 (if/else) ✓
  - T09.G4.01 (user input) ✓
  - T08.G7.01 (state machines) ✗
If any are missing, provide intervention first.
```

#### Strategy 3: Hub Skill Mastery Tracking
Track these 27 skills separately in your gradebook.

```
Student Gateway Skill Mastery:
- T06.G1.01 (sequences) - Mastered
- T07.G3.01 (loops) - Mastered
- T08.G3.01 (if/else) - In Progress
- T09.G3.01 (variables) - Not Started

## Part 2: Capstone Skills (Skills with Most Prerequisites)

### What's a Capstone Skill?

A capstone skill is one that requires mastery of 3+ other skills. These are integrative, complex skills that demonstrate advanced proficiency.

**Why they matter**: Capstone skills represent the "mountaintop" of learning. Students working on capstones integrate multiple concepts and demonstrate readiness for advanced topics.

### Top Capstone Skills

| Skill | Prerequisites | Complexity | Grade | Domain |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **T26.G8.02** Complete data investigation | 5 | Very High | 8 | Data |
| **T27.G8.01** Design and conduct investigation | 4 | Very High | 8 | Data |
| **T26.G6.05** Clean and prepare data | 3 | High | 6 | Data |
| **T26.G7.03** Manipulate data with code | 3 | High | 7 | Data |

## Part 3: Hub Skills (High Connectivity)

### What's a Hub Skill?

A hub skill has both:
- Many prerequisites (requires advanced knowledge)
- Many dependents (enables many downstream skills)

These are the "crossroads" of the curriculum.

### Top Hub Skills

| Skill | Prerequisites | Dependents | Centrality |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| T10.G4.01 | 2+ | 12 | Very High |
| T09.G3.01 | 1+ | 11 | Very High |
| T09.G4.01 | 1+ | 10 | Very High |
| T08.G3.01 | 1+ | 9 | High |
| T08.G4.01 | 2+ | 8 | High |
| T07.G3.01 | 1+ | 7 | High |
| T11.G4.01 | 2+ | 7 | High |

### Why Hub Skills Matter

Hub skills are **resilience points** in the curriculum. Students who understand hub skills well are flexible - they can apply knowledge in multiple contexts.

**Example**: T09.G3.01 (variable types)
- Prerequisite: T09.G2.01 (understand variables exist)
- Enables: 11 downstream skills including data operations, AI, games
- Mastery means: Student understands that different types of data need different treatment

### Teaching Hub Skills

1. **Spend extra time** - allocate 3-4 lessons instead of 2
2. **Use multiple contexts** - show variables in games, data, simulations
3. **Build mastery deeply** - don't move on until 90%+ of students can apply it
4. **Create transfer tasks** - ask students to use the skill in new contexts

## Part 4: Foundational vs. Advanced Skills

### Foundational Skills (No Prerequisites)

These 50+ skills are true starting points - students can learn them without prior programming knowledge.

**Examples**:
- T01.G1.01 - Write or draw steps
- T02.G1.01 - Follow simple directions
- T06.G1.01 - Build simple sequence
- T04.G1.01 - Find repeating patterns

**Why important**: These are entry points into the curriculum. Use them for:
- Students new to programming
- Remediation for struggling students
- Building confidence

### Advanced/Specialist Skills

Skills that require 3+ prerequisites. Examples:
- T26.G8.02 - Complete data investigation (5 prerequisites)
- T27.G8.01 - Design investigation (4 prerequisites)
- T29.G8.04 - Evaluate NLP ethics (3 prerequisites)

**Why important**: These are the "summit" skills. Students reaching them have demonstrated comprehensive mastery across multiple domains.

## Part 5: Strategic Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Create Guarantee Lists

For each grade level, identify 5-7 gateway skills that **all students must master**.

**Example - Grade 3 Guarantee List**:
- [ ] T06.G3.01 - Build a simple sequence with a tool
- [ ] T07.G3.01 - Use a repeat loop
- [ ] T08.G2.01 - Use if/then (from G2, reinforced)
- [ ] T09.G3.01 - Use different variable types
- [ ] T01.G3.01 - Create a simple algorithm in code

**Implementation**: Track these separately. Don't move a student to Grade 4 without mastery of Grade 3 guarantees.

### Recommendation 2: Tiered Remediation

When a student struggles on a skill:

**Level 1**: Check gateway prerequisites
- Is the student missing T09.G3.01 (variable types)?
- If yes, reteach that skill first

**Level 2**: Check conceptual understanding
- Can the student explain what the skill does in their own words?
- Can they apply it to a new problem (transfer)?

**Level 3**: Provide scaffolded practice
- Partially-solved examples
- Worked examples with explanation
- Guided practice with decreasing support

### Recommendation 3: Enrichment for Advanced Students

When a student masters a skill early:

**Option 1**: Move to next gateway skill in sequence
- If student masters T07.G3.01 (loops) in October, move to T08.G3.01 (conditionals)

**Option 2**: Go deep on current skill
- Create transfer tasks: use loops in new contexts
- Explore variations: nested loops, loops with conditions

**Option 3**: Begin specialization
- If student shows aptitude for games (T14), accelerate game pathway
- If student shows aptitude for data (T25+), accelerate data pathway

### Recommendation 4: Parent Communication

Help parents understand gateway skills:

```
Parent Email - November (Mid-Grade 4):

Hi [Parent Name],

[Student] is making great progress in computer science!
This month, we're focusing on a very important skill:

GATEWAY SKILL: Variables (T09.G4.01)
What it is: Storing and using information in a program
Why it matters: 10+ advanced skills depend on this foundation
Mastery goal: [Student] can create variables, store values,
              and update them in their programs

How you can help:
- Ask "What are variables in your program?"
- Help them notice variables in everyday life ("How does your
  game keep score?")

Next steps: Once [Student] masters variables, they'll be ready
to learn lists, functions, and complex programs.

[Teacher Name]
```
