GRADE K - PHASE 2 QUICK FIX GUIDE
================================================================================

Total Grade K Skills: 97
Status: Excellent overall, minor enhancements needed
Changes: 6 dependency additions, 2-3 possible removals

================================================================================
HIGH PRIORITY ADDITIONS (3)
================================================================================

1. T14.GK.01 - Add dependency on T06.GK.01
   Skill: Match controls to character actions
   Add: * T06.GK.01: Order pictures showing a morning routine (event sequence concept)
   Why: Game controls are events - need event understanding first

2. T14.GK.02 - Add dependency on T09.GK.01
   Skill: Recognize a score in simple games
   Add: * T09.GK.01: Recognize that a label can hold a number
   Why: Score is a variable/number - need variable understanding first

3. T13.GK.02 - Add dependency on T01.GK.01
   Skill: Retry after noticing something went wrong
   Add: * T01.GK.01: Put pictures in order for getting ready for bed
   Why: Debugging needs understanding of correct sequences

================================================================================
MEDIUM PRIORITY ADDITIONS (3)
================================================================================

4. T26.GK.01 - Add dependency on T09.GK.01
   Skill: Identify countable things in a picture
   Add: * T09.GK.01: Recognize that a label can hold a number
   Why: Counting data requires understanding numbers

5. T26.GK.02 - Add dependency on T09.GK.01
   Skill: Use tokens to log repeated events
   Add: * T09.GK.01: Recognize that a label can hold a number
   Why: Logging counts requires understanding numbers
   Note: Already depends on T26.GK.01, creates path to T09.GK.01

6. T27.GK.01 - Add dependency on T10.GK.01
   Skill: Sort objects by a rule and explain it
   Add: * T10.GK.01: Sort picture cards into groups
   Why: Data sorting builds on general sorting concepts

================================================================================
TRANSITIVE REDUNDANCIES TO REVIEW (3)
================================================================================

CONSERVATIVE: Only remove if TRULY redundant!

1. T02.GK.04 → T02.GK.02
   Current: T02.GK.04 → T02.GK.03 → T02.GK.02 AND T02.GK.04 → T02.GK.02
   Decision: KEEP (may be pedagogically valuable)

2. T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.01
   Current: T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.02 → T24.GK.01 AND T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.01
   Decision: Consider removing direct T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.01
   Reason: Clear sequence, transitive should be sufficient

3. T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.01
   Current: T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.02 → T29.GK.01 AND T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.01
   Decision: Consider removing direct T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.01
   Reason: Clear sequence, transitive should be sufficient

================================================================================
VALIDATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

✓ X-2 Rule: All GK skills depend only on GK skills (100% compliant)
✓ Circular Dependencies: None found
✓ Invalid References: None found
✓ Foundational Skills: 31 skills (good distribution)
✓ Max Dependency Depth: 4 (appropriate for kindergarten)

================================================================================
CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCY SUMMARY
================================================================================

Existing patterns (working well):
- T02 → T01: Algorithm diagrams build on everyday algorithms
- T20 → T04: Art builds on patterns (excellent!)
- T15 → T01: Stories build on sequences
- T13 → T01: Debugging builds on sequences

Adding (Phase 2):
- T14 → T06: Games build on events
- T14 → T09: Games build on variables
- T13 → T01: Debugging builds on sequences (strengthen)
- T26 → T09: Data counting builds on numbers
- T27 → T10: Data sorting builds on grouping

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
================================================================================

1. Add HIGH PRIORITY dependencies (3 additions)
2. Add MEDIUM PRIORITY dependencies (3 additions)
3. Review and decide on transitive redundancies (2-3 possible removals)
4. Review within-topic gaps if time permits (7 cases in full report)

================================================================================

EXAMPLES (Before/After)
================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: T14.GK.02 (HIGH PRIORITY)
Before:
ID: T14.GK.02
Topic: T14 – 2D Games
Skill: Recognize a score in simple games
Description: ...
[No dependencies]

After:
ID: T14.GK.02
Topic: T14 – 2D Games
Skill: Recognize a score in simple games
Description: ...

Dependencies:
* T09.GK.01: Recognize that a label can hold a number

---

EXAMPLE 2: T24.GK.03 (REDUNDANCY REMOVAL)
Before:
ID: T24.GK.03
Topic: T24 – XO & Generative AI Practices
Skill: Predict which "helper" is better for the job
Description: ...

Dependencies:
* T24.GK.01: Identify AI as a computer helper
