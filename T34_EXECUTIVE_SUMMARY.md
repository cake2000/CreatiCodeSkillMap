# T34 Computing History - Executive Summary
**Date:** 2024-11-24

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: 1 Misplaced Skill
**T34.G1.03** does not belong in Computing History topic
- Skill about programming tool selection belongs in T25 (Game Design) or T26 (App Design)
- Must be removed from T34 immediately

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY: 4 Dependency Violations
Skills violating the X-2 dependency rule:
1. **T34.G5.02:** References G3 skill (2 grades back)
2. **T34.G5.03:** References G2 skill (3 grades back!)
3. **T34.G6.02:** References G4 skill (2 grades back)
4. **T34.G6.03:** References G4 skill (2 grades back)

### ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY: Content Appropriateness
1. **T34.G4.03:** Too technically advanced for Grade 4 (GPUs, network bandwidth, AI)
2. **T34.G2.02:** Slightly advanced for Grade 2 (understanding exclusion/harm)

---

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

**Status:** NEEDS REVISION (but fundamentally sound)

### What's Working Well ✅
- Excellent K-2 unplugged activities (spotting devices, comparing old/new tech)
- Strong progression from concrete to abstract thinking
- Diversity and inclusion integrated throughout all grade levels
- Outstanding Grade 6-8 analytical skills (computing waves, failure analysis, forecasting)
- Good cross-topic connections (T01 sequencing, T35 ethics)
- Age-appropriate research activities

### What Needs Fixing ❌
- 1 completely misplaced skill
- 4 dependency chain violations
- 1 skill too advanced for assigned grade level
- Some skill titles too long

---

## QUICK FIXES REQUIRED

### FIX #1: Remove T34.G1.03
```
ACTION: Delete from T34, relocate to T25 or T26
REASON: About tool selection, not history
```

### FIX #2-5: Correct Dependencies
```
T34.G5.02: T34.G3.01 → T34.G4.01
T34.G5.03: T34.G2.03 → T34.G4.02
T34.G6.02: Remove T34.G4.02 dependency
T34.G6.03: Remove T34.G4.01 dependency
```

### FIX #6: Address T34.G4.03
```
OPTION A: Move to Grade 6
OPTION B: Significantly simplify for Grade 4
```

## SKILL COUNT BY GRADE

| Grade | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| K | 3 | ✅ All good |
| 1 | 3 | ❌ 1 misplaced |
| 2 | 3 | ⚠️ 1 slightly advanced |
| 3 | 3 | ✅ All good |
| 4 | 3 | ⚠️ 1 too advanced |
| 5 | 3 | ⚠️ 2 dep violations |
| 6 | 3 | ⚠️ 2 dep violations |
| 7 | 3 | ✅ All good |
| 8 | 3 | ✅ All good |
| **Total** | **27** | **6 issues** |

---

## PROGRESSION THEMES

**K-2:** Recognition and Understanding
- Spot devices, compare old/new, understand change, recognize people

**3-5:** Analysis and Research
- Timelines, cause/effect, regional comparison, social movements, interviews

**6-8:** Critical Synthesis
- Computing waves, inclusion/exclusion, failures, AI history, policies, forecasting

---

## DEPENDENCY HEALTH

✅ **Internal T34 dependencies:** Mostly good (except 4 violations)
✅ **Cross-topic dependencies:** Appropriate (T01 sequencing)
✅ **Mentioned connections:** Good (T35 ethics)
❌ **X-2 Rule violations:** 4 skills need fixing

---

## UNPLUGGED vs BLOCK-BASED

✅ **K-2:** Appropriately unplugged (pictures, stories, simple charts)
✅ **3+:** Mix of research, writing, and some digital creation
✅ **CreatiCode usage:** Limited but appropriate (G7.03, G8.03)

Note: Computing History naturally lends itself to research and analysis rather than heavy block programming.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS PRIORITY

### MUST FIX (Before deployment)
1. Remove T34.G1.03 from T34
2. Fix 4 dependency violations
3. Address T34.G4.03 complexity

### SHOULD FIX (Soon)
4. Simplify T34.G2.02 language
5. Shorten T34.G5.01 title
6. Add more CreatiCode integration opportunities

### COULD IMPROVE (Optional)
7. Add internet history skill (G2-3)
8. Add gaming history skill connecting to T25
9. More interactive timeline projects

---

## BOTTOM LINE

T34 is a **well-designed topic** with excellent thematic progression and strong integration of diversity, equity, and critical thinking.

After fixing **6 specific issues** (1 critical, 4 high priority, 1 medium priority), this will be an exemplary Computing History curriculum for grades K-8.

The topic successfully balances historical knowledge with contemporary relevance, making computing history engaging and meaningful for students.
