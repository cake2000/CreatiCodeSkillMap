Skill: Define social engineering and explain why attacks target humans
Description: Students learn that social engineering attacks target people, not computers: (1) Define social engineering as "tricking people into giving information or access," (2) Compare to technical hacking (finding holes in code vs finding holes in trust), (3) Analyze why humans are the "weakest link" (can be rushed, want to be helpful, make mistakes under pressure), (4) List psychological tactics attackers use: urgency ("Act now!"), authority ("I'm from IT"), fear ("Your account will close"), curiosity ("See who viewed your profile"). They explain why even good security systems fail if users are tricked.
