================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

H1. DEPENDENCY X-2 RULE VIOLATIONS (Critical - breaks curriculum structure)

Skills with dependencies that violate X-2 rule:

a) T01.G3.13: Debug a program with steps in the wrong order
   - Depends on: T09.G3.01 (Create and use a numeric variable)
   - ISSUE: This is a simple sequencing debug task, but it depends on variables
   - SEVERITY: High - creates unnecessary prerequisite
   - RATIONALE: Debugging sequence order doesn't require variable knowledge
   - FIX: Remove T09.G3.01 dependency; skill can stand alone with T06.G3.01

b) T01.G3.14: Debug a loop that repeats the wrong number of times
   - Depends on: T09.G3.01 (Create and use a numeric variable)
   - ISSUE: Debugging loop counts doesn't inherently require variables
   - SEVERITY: High - creates unnecessary prerequisite
   - FIX: Remove T09.G3.01; keep only T07.G3.01 (loop knowledge)

c) T01.G3.15: Debug an if/then that doesn't trigger when it should
   - Depends on: T09.G3.01 (Create and use a numeric variable)
   - ISSUE: Debugging if/then conditions doesn't require variables
   - SEVERITY: High - creates unnecessary prerequisite
   - FIX: Remove T09.G3.01; keep only T08.G3.01 (if/then knowledge)

d) T01.G7.01: Identify the pattern in a given program
   - Depends on: T06.G5.01 (Build project with multiple sprites)
   - ISSUE: G7 skill depending on G5 skill
   - SEVERITY: Medium-High - violates X-2 rule (G7 shouldn't depend on G5)
   - FIX: Change to T06.G6.01 or T06.G7.01, OR remove sprite requirement

e) T01.G8.10: Use logging/probes to understand algorithm behavior
   - Depends on: T06.G6.01 (Create custom blocks with inputs)
   - ISSUE: G8 depending on G6 - violates X-2 rule
   - SEVERITY: Medium - but still a violation
   - FIX: Change to T06.G7.01 or similar G7-G8 skill


H2. SKILLS WITH UNCLEAR OR NON-ACTIONABLE DESCRIPTIONS

a) T01.G1.03: Add a missing last step to a routine
   - Description: "Students see a 3-step routine and choose the correct 4th step"
   - ISSUE: Not specific about context - what kind of routine?
   - FIX: Add example context (e.g., "making lunch," "preparing for school")

b) T01.G1.04: Predict the next step in a story sequence
   - ISSUE: Almost identical to T01.G1.03
   - OVERLAP: Both skills ask students to predict/add the next step
   - FIX: Differentiate - G1.03 for everyday routines, G1.04 for narrative stories

c) T01.G1.09: Match an algorithm to its goal
   - Description: "Students match short routines to labels"
   - ISSUE: Too vague - what makes this different from earlier matching?
   - FIX: Specify that this involves choosing from MULTIPLE goals


H3. MISSING FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS FOR GRADE 3+ TRANSITION

a) Missing: "Recognize that pictures can be turned into code blocks"
   - GAP: K-2 uses pictures; G3+ uses blocks
   - LOCATION: Should be between G2 and G3
   - SEVERITY: High - critical bridge concept
   - FIX: Add T01.G2.15 or similar transitional skill

b) Missing: "Match picture sequences to simple block sequences"
   - GAP: Students need to see the connection before G3
   - LOCATION: G2 end
   - SEVERITY: High - scaffolding gap
   - FIX: Add explicit picture-to-block mapping skill


H4. GRADE APPROPRIATENESS ISSUES

a) T01.GK.08: Count how many times
   - Description: Requires counting actions in animation
   - ISSUE: May be too abstract for Kindergarten without concrete support
   - SEVERITY: Medium-High - needs more scaffolding
   - FIX: Clarify that choices are picture-based (not numbers)

b) T01.G3.03: Identify repeated blocks in a script (no loops)
   - Depends on: T04.G2.01 (Grade 2 skill)
   - ISSUE: G3 skill depending on G2 cross-topic skill is fine, but...
   - CONCERN: Description says "specific project script" - needs clearer context
   - FIX: Specify a concrete, familiar project type

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

M1. POTENTIAL OVERLAPS AND DUPLICATES

a) T01.GK.03 vs T01.GK.06
   - GK.03: "Find the first and last pictures"
   - GK.06: "What comes next?" (predict last picture)
   - OVERLAP: Both focus on sequence endpoints
   - SEVERITY: Medium - concepts are related but distinct
   - ASSESSMENT: ACCEPTABLE - GK.03 is identification, GK.06 is prediction

b) T01.G2.01, T01.G2.02, T01.G2.03 (Repeat progression)
   - Good progression: recognize → use → replace
   - ASSESSMENT: GOOD - no overlap, proper scaffolding

c) T01.G3.11 vs T01.G3.12
   - G3.11: "Explain in words what a short program does"
   - G3.12: "Predict the final state of a simple algorithm"
   - OVERLAP: Both involve code reading and prediction
   - DIFFERENCE: G3.11 is about overall behavior; G3.12 is specific state
   - ASSESSMENT: ACCEPTABLE - distinct enough


M2. SKILLS THAT ARE TOO BROAD

a) T01.G4.12: Explain why one algorithm solution is better than another
   - Description: "Compare two working algorithms and explain preference"
   - ISSUE: Very open-ended for G4; criteria not specified upfront
   - SEVERITY: Medium - could be overwhelming
   - FIX: Provide specific comparison criteria (steps, readability, speed)

b) T01.G5.02: Convert a flowchart or pseudocode into code
   - ISSUE: Combines TWO different tasks (flowchart AND pseudocode)
   - SEVERITY: Medium - should be split
   - FIX: Break into T01.G5.02 (flowchart) and T01.G5.02.02 (pseudocode)

c) T01.G6.08: Implement code from a detailed flowchart
   - Description: "map each shape in detailed, multi-step flowchart to code"
   - ISSUE: "Detailed, multi-step" is vague - how many steps?
   - FIX: Specify expected complexity (e.g., "5-8 steps with 1-2 decisions")


M3. MISSING INTERMEDIATE SCAFFOLDING

a) Jump from T01.G2.14 (grid navigation) to T01.G3.01 (scripts)
   - GAP: No explicit connection between picture-based navigation and coding
   - SEVERITY: Medium - transition could be smoother
   - FIX: Consider adding G2 skill that shows grid commands AS blocks

b) Jump from T01.G4.12 (comparison) to T01.G5.01 (flowcharts)
   - GAP: Flowcharts appear suddenly in G5 without G4 introduction
   - NOTE: This might be handled by T02 (Planning & Problem Solving)
   - ACTION: Verify T02.G4.x introduces flowcharts; if so, add dependency

c) Jump from T01.G7.08 (patterns) to T01.G8.01 (simulations)
   - GAP: Simulations are complex; needs more scaffolding
   - SEVERITY: Medium - steep conceptual leap
   - FIX: Consider adding simpler G7 skill about state over time


M4. DEPENDENCY CHAIN CONCERNS

a) T01.G3.12: Predict the final state of a simple algorithm
   - Depends on: T14.G3.01 (Move sprite with arrow keys)
   - ISSUE: Dependency on T14 seems unusual for T01
   - QUESTION: Why does predicting algorithm state require keyboard input?
   - SEVERITY: Medium - may be too specific
   - FIX: Consider broader dependency or remove T14 dependency


M5. ASSESSMENT CLARITY

a) Multiple skills use "MCQ; auto-graded" without specifying rubric
   - Examples: T01.G3.09, T01.G3.10, T01.G4.05
   - ISSUE: Not always clear what makes an answer correct
   - SEVERITY: Low-Medium - implementation concern
   - FIX: Ensure descriptions specify what correct answer demonstrates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOW PRIORITY ISSUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L1. SKILL DESCRIPTION CONSISTENCY

a) Implementation notes vary in detail
   - Some are very specific: "Drag-drop sequence (3 items)"
   - Others are vague: "Coding; auto-graded"
   - SEVERITY: Low - but could be standardized
   - FIX: Develop consistent format for implementation notes

b) CSTA standard citations incomplete in some skills
   - Most skills have CSTA tags
   - A few are missing or inconsistent
   - SEVERITY: Low - metadata issue
   - FIX: Audit and complete all CSTA citations


L2. MINOR WORDING IMPROVEMENTS

a) T01.G2.11: "Trace maze directions on a simple grid"
   - "Maze" might imply complexity
   - FIX: Consider "path-finding" or "navigation" for clarity

b) T01.G6.01: "Count comparisons in linear and binary search"
   - Description says "qualitatively compare" but title says "count"
   - INCONSISTENCY: Title implies quantitative, description is qualitative
   - FIX: Change title to "Compare linear and binary search efficiency"


L3. AI4K12 INTEGRATION

a) Only G6 and G8 skills reference AI4K12 standards
   - T01.G6.05, G6.06 (fairness)
   - T01.G8.01, G8.02, G8.03 (modeling)
   - T01.G8.06, G8.07 (ethics)
   - QUESTION: Are there missed opportunities in earlier grades?
   - SEVERITY: Low - but worth considering
   - ACTION: Review K-5 for age-appropriate AI literacy integration

================================================================================
3. DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS BY ISSUE
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION R1: FIX X-2 DEPENDENCY VIOLATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Action Items:
1. T01.G3.13 - Remove T09.G3.01 dependency
   Rationale: Debugging sequence order is about flow, not variables
   Keep: T06.G3.01 (basic scripting)

2. T01.G3.14 - Remove T09.G3.01 dependency
   Rationale: Loop debugging focuses on iteration count, not variable state
   Keep: T07.G3.01 (loop knowledge)

3. T01.G3.15 - Remove T09.G3.01 dependency
   Rationale: Conditional debugging is about Boolean logic, not variables
   Keep: T08.G3.01 (if/then knowledge)

4. T01.G7.01 - Update dependency
   Change from: T06.G5.01
   Change to: T06.G6.01 or T06.G7.01 (within X-2 range)

5. T01.G8.10 - Update dependency
   Change from: T06.G6.01
   Change to: T06.G7.01 or similar G7-G8 skill
   Check: Does G8.10 really require custom blocks with inputs?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION R2: IMPROVE SKILL DESCRIPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skills Needing Description Enhancement:

T01.G1.03: Add a missing last step to a routine
CURRENT: "Students see a 3-step routine and choose the correct 4th step."
IMPROVED: "Students see a 3-step routine (e.g., making a sandwich: get bread, add peanut butter, add jelly) and choose the correct 4th step from pictures (eat, clean up, share). Implementation note: MCQ picture choice with 3-4 plausible options."

T01.G1.04: Predict the next step in a story sequence
CURRENT: "Students see 3 ordered panels and choose what happens next."
IMPROVED: "Students see 3 story panels (e.g., character sees ball, walks toward ball, reaches for ball) and choose what happens next from picture options. Focus on narrative cause-and-effect, not everyday routines. Implementation note: MCQ visuals with story context."

T01.G1.09: Match an algorithm to its goal
CURRENT: "Students match short routines to labels like 'clean desk,' 'feed pet,' 'get ready for recess.'"
IMPROVED: "Students match 3-4 short picture-based routines (4-5 steps each) to goal labels from a list of 5-6 options, requiring them to distinguish between similar goals. Implementation note: Matching lines between sequences and goals; auto-graded."

T01.G4.12: Explain why one algorithm solution is better than another
CURRENT: "Students compare two working algorithms and explain which they prefer."
IMPROVED: "Students compare two working algorithms that achieve the same goal and explain which is better using specific criteria: fewer steps, easier to understand, or faster execution. Implementation note: MCQ selecting best algorithm + choosing explanation from provided reasons (clarity, efficiency, brevity)."

T01.G6.01: Count comparisons in linear and binary search
CURRENT TITLE: "Count comparisons in linear and binary search"
DESCRIPTION: "Students qualitatively compare..."
IMPROVED TITLE: "Compare efficiency of linear and binary search"
KEEP DESCRIPTION: Aligns title with actual task


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION R3: ADD MISSING TRANSITIONAL SKILLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW SKILL: T01.G2.15 - Recognize picture sequences as code blocks
ID: T01.G2.15
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Match picture instructions to block-based commands
Description: Students match simple picture-based instruction sequences (e.g., arrow cards for movement) to equivalent visual block commands (e.g., "move forward" blocks), recognizing that pictures and blocks can represent the same algorithm. Implementation note: Drag-and-drop matching; auto-graded. CSTA: E2-ALG-AF-01.
Dependencies:
* T01.G2.13: Write directions to navigate a simple grid

Rationale: This bridges the K-2 picture-based approach with the G3+ block-coding approach, making the transition explicit rather than implicit.

ALTERNATIVE NEW SKILL: T01.G2.16 - Identify repeated picture sequences in grid paths
(If we need more scaffolding for the repeat concept)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION R4: CLARIFY GRADE-APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

T01.GK.08: Count how many times
CURRENT: "Watch the character. Count how many times they do the same action."
IMPROVED: "Watch the character perform a repeated action (e.g., jump, clap). Count how many times by selecting from picture-based answer choices showing 1, 2, 3, or 4 actions. Implementation note: Short animation (2-4 seconds) + picture-based count choices (no numerals for non-readers). CSTA: EK-ALG-AF-01."

T01.G3.03: Identify repeated blocks in a script
CURRENT: "...in a *specific project script*"
IMPROVED: "Students highlight which blocks repeat in a short, familiar project script (e.g., a sprite drawing a square or a character dancing). The project should have a clear, simple goal that students can understand before examining the code. Implementation note: Highlight or click region in code; project examples: draw shape, simple animation. CSTA: E3-ALG-AF-01."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION R5: SPLIT OVERLY BROAD SKILLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

T01.G5.02: Convert a flowchart or pseudocode into code
SPLIT INTO:

T01.G5.02.01: Convert a simple flowchart into code
Description: Students implement a simple flowchart (5-7 steps, 1-2 decisions, 0-1 loops) as block-based code for a small CreatiCode project. Implementation note: Coding; auto-graded on behavior and basic correspondence between flowchart shapes and code blocks. CSTA: E5-ALG-AF-01, E5-PRO-PF-01.
Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script

T01.G5.02.02: Convert simple pseudocode into code
Description: Students implement simple pseudocode (that follows patterns already practiced in T02.G4-G5) as block-based code for a small CreatiCode project, focusing on translating structured text descriptions into equivalent block commands. Implementation note: Coding; auto-graded on behavior and correspondence. CSTA: E5-ALG-AF-01, E5-PRO-PF-01.
Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count

Rationale: Flowcharts and pseudocode are different representations requiring distinct translation skills. Splitting allows more targeted practice.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDATION R6: VERIFY CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Action Items:
1. Check T02 (Planning & Problem Solving) for flowchart introduction
   - Verify T02.G4.x or earlier introduces flowchart symbols
   - If yes: Add explicit T02 dependencies to T01.G5.01, G6.07
   - If no: Consider whether T01 should introduce flowcharts or T02 should

2. Verify T04 (Patterns & Repetition) progression supports T01
   - T01.G2.01 depends on T04.G1.03 (repeated steps)
   - T01.G3.03 depends on T04.G2.01 (repeating units)
   - CHECK: Is T04 scaffolding adequate for these T01 skills?

3. Review T01.G3.12 dependency on T14.G3.01
   - QUESTION: Is keyboard movement necessary for "predict final state"?
   - ALTERNATIVE: Dependency could be T06.G3.01 + T07.G3.01 (general scripting)
   - ACTION: Clarify whether T14 dependency is essential or overly restrictive

4. Ensure T06, T07, T08, T09 are properly sequenced for T01.G3-G5
   - Most G3+ skills depend on foundational programming skills
   - CHECK: Are these topics scheduled before or alongside T01 in curriculum?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Strength: Code quality (G8.08-09)
- Concern: G8.04-05 (recursion) might need more scaffolding
- SUGGESTION: Consider G7 introduction to recursive thinking


Suggested New Skills for Consideration:

T01.G4.13: Recognize when a loop can replace repeated code
Description: Students examine short scripts and identify sections where repeated blocks could be replaced by a loop, even if the blocks aren't identical but follow a pattern. This prepares for G5 refactoring work.
Dependencies: T07.G3.01, T07.G4.01 (if it exists)

T01.G6.09: Trace a simple sorting algorithm step-by-step
Description: Students follow a bubble sort or selection sort on 4-5 items, marking which items swap at each step. Focus on understanding the process, not implementing it.
Dependencies: T07.G5.01 or similar (nested loops might be needed)

T01.G7.09: Identify the core idea of a recursive algorithm
Description: Students match recursive algorithm descriptions (factorial, Fibonacci, tree traversal) to their "big idea" (break problem into smaller same-type problem). Prepares for G8.04-05.
Dependencies: None specific, but comes after G7.01-08

NEW SKILL 1: T01.G2.15 - Bridge picture-based to block-based coding

ID: T01.G2.15
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Match picture instructions to visual block commands
Description: Students match simple picture-based instruction sequences (e.g., arrow cards showing "forward, forward, turn right") to equivalent visual block-based commands (e.g., blocks showing "move forward," "move forward," "turn right"), recognizing that pictures and blocks can represent the same algorithm with the same outcome. _Implementation note: Drag-and-drop matching with 3-4 sequence pairs; auto-graded. Focus on 1-to-1 correspondence between picture symbols and block icons. CSTA: E2-ALG-AF-01._

Dependencies:
* T01.G2.13: Write directions to navigate a simple grid

RATIONALE: This creates an explicit bridge between K-2's picture-based approach and G3+'s block-coding approach, making the transition smoother and more intentional. Students see that the representation changes but the underlying algorithm concept remains the same.


NEW SKILL 2: T01.G5.02.01 and T01.G5.02.02 - Split flowchart/pseudocode conversion

(This replaces the current T01.G5.02, which is too broad)

ID: T01.G5.02.01
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Convert a simple flowchart into code
Description: Students implement a simple flowchart (5-7 steps with 1-2 decision diamonds and 0-1 loop structures) as block-based code for a small CreatiCode project. Focus on mapping flowchart symbols (rectangles → action blocks, diamonds → if/then, loop connectors → repeat) to code constructs. _Implementation note: Coding task; auto-graded on behavior matching flowchart logic and basic structural correspondence between shapes and blocks. Project examples: simple game turn, animated sequence with choices. CSTA: E5-ALG-AF-01, E5-PRO-PF-01._

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* [ADD: T02.G4.x or T02.G5.x for flowchart symbols, once verified]

ID: T01.G5.02.02
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Convert simple pseudocode into code
Description: Students implement simple pseudocode (structured text with REPEAT, IF/THEN, SET variable) as block-based code for a small CreatiCode project. Pseudocode uses conventions introduced in T02 (structured English with keywords in caps). Focus on translating text descriptions of actions into equivalent block commands. _Implementation note: Coding task; auto-graded on behavior and correspondence to pseudocode intent. Project examples: score tracker, animated routine with conditions. CSTA: E5-ALG-AF-01, E5-PRO-PF-01._

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count
* [ADD: T02.G4.x or T02.G5.x for pseudocode conventions, once verified]

RATIONALE: Flowchart-to-code and pseudocode-to-code are distinct translation skills. Flowcharts emphasize visual-spatial reasoning and symbol mapping. Pseudocode emphasizes reading structured text and keyword recognition. Splitting allows targeted practice and clearer assessment of each skill.


OPTIONAL NEW SKILL 3: T01.G7.09 - Introduce recursive thinking concept

ID: T01.G7.09
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Recognize the recursive pattern in algorithm descriptions
Description: Students read natural-language descriptions of algorithms (e.g., "To count blocks in a stack: if stack is empty, answer 0; otherwise, count 1 for the top block plus the count of the remaining stack") and identify the "big idea" of recursion: solving a problem by solving a smaller version of the same problem. _Implementation note: MCQ matching descriptions to concepts ("breaks problem into smaller same-type problems," "uses a base case to stop," "calls itself with simpler input"); no code implementation. CSTA: MS-ALG-PS-07._

Dependencies:
* T07.G6.01: [Appropriate loop skill - understanding iteration helps contrast with recursion]

RATIONALE: G8.04-05 introduce recursion conceptually but with little G7 scaffolding. This G7 skill builds intuition for "solving via smaller versions" before G8 requires tracing recursive algorithms, making the G8 transition smoother.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total Existing Skills Modified: 12
- Description improvements: 6 (G1.03, G1.04, G1.09, GK.08, G3.03, G4.12)
- Title clarification: 1 (G6.01)
- Dependency fixes (X-2 violations): 5 (G3.13, G3.14, G3.15, G7.01, G8.10)

Total New Skills Proposed: 3-4
- Required: T01.G2.15 (picture-to-block bridge)
- Required: T01.G5.02.01 and T01.G5.02.02 (split flowchart/pseudocode)

(Per instructions: NEVER delete skills)

Renumbering Required:
- If T01.G2.15 is added: Renumber G3+ skills by +1 (G3.01 becomes G3.02, etc.)
  ALTERNATIVE: Use T01.G2.15 without renumbering rest
- If T01.G5.02 is split: T01.G5.03-G5.10 become G5.04-G5.11
  ALTERNATIVE: Use sub-IDs (G5.02.01, G5.02.02) to avoid renumbering

RECOMMENDATION: Use sub-IDs to avoid cascading renumbering:
- T01.G2.15 remains T01.G2.15 (inserted after G2.14)
- T01.G5.02.01 and G5.02.02 replace G5.02
- T01.G7.09 remains G7.09 (inserted after G7.08)

================================================================================
5. VERIFICATION AGAINST CREATICODE PLATFORM
================================================================================

Since T01 - Everyday Algorithms focuses on algorithmic thinking concepts rather than specific platform features, most skills are platform-independent or use fundamental blocks available in any block-coding environment.

Key Platform Features Used in T01:
- Motion blocks (move, turn, point in direction) - VERIFIED in blockdes8.txt
- Control blocks (repeat, if/then, wait) - Standard Scratch/CreatiCode
- Variables (create, set, change) - Standard Scratch/CreatiCode
- Events (green flag, key press) - Standard Scratch/CreatiCode
- Looks (say, show, hide) - Standard Scratch/CreatiCode

Platform Concerns: None identified
- T01 skills teach algorithmic thinking using basic blocks
- No advanced CreatiCode-specific features required
- Grid/maze navigation (G2.11-14) can be implemented with standard motion
- All specified blocks are available in CreatiCode

Recommendation: No platform-related changes needed for T01 skills.

+ Strong internal coherence within each grade band
+ Good integration of algorithmic concepts (sequence, loops, conditionals, variables)
+ Appropriate introduction of efficiency and ethics in middle grades
+ Clear scaffolding within concepts (e.g., repeat progression in G2)
+ Good balance of unplugged (K-2) and plugged (G3+) approaches

Issues Found and Addressed:
