## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added K-1 Foundation (7 New Skills)

**Kindergarten (3 skills):**
- **T28.GK.01**: Identify "always" and "never" events using pictures
- **T28.GK.02**: Use "likely" and "unlikely" vocabulary appropriately
- **T28.GK.03**: Sort events by frequency (always/sometimes/never)

**Grade 1 (4 skills):**
- **T28.G1.01**: Compare outcomes of simple chance experiments (unplugged)
- **T28.G1.02**: Predict outcomes and check with trials
- **T28.G1.03**: Recognize when games use chance vs. skill
- **T28.G1.04**: Conduct 10 repeated trials with picture recording

**Impact**: Fills critical gap, establishes vocabulary foundation, provides proper entry point for G2 skills

### 2. Fixed X-2 Rule Violations (2 Critical Fixes)

**T28.G5.01.02** (Grade 5 skill):
- ❌ Removed: T27.G3.04 (Grade 3 - violated X-2 rule)
- ✅ Added: T27.G4.02d, T27.G4.04 (Grade 4 - compliant)

**T28.G5.08** (Grade 5 skill):
- ❌ Removed: T03.G3.01 (Grade 3 - violated X-2 rule)
- ✅ Added: T28.G4.05 (Grade 4 - compliant, within-topic)

**Impact**: 100% compliance with X-2 rule (dependencies only at grades X, X-1, X-2)

---

### 3. Split Overly Complex Skills (3 → 8 Sub-Skills)

**T28.G3.05** → 2 sub-skills:
- **T28.G3.05.01**: Analyze randomness in familiar games (analysis only)
- **T28.G3.05.02**: Code a simple game element simulation (implementation only)

**T28.G8.01** → 3 sub-skills:
- **T28.G8.01.01**: Collect simulation data from parameter sweeps
- **T28.G8.01.02**: Create visualizations from simulation results
- **T28.G8.01.03**: Build interactive simulation dashboard

**T28.G8.04** → 3 sub-skills:
- **T28.G8.04.01**: Conduct policy-relevant simulation

- **T28.G8.04.03**: Write and publish policy brief with ethical analysis

**Impact**: Each sub-skill is now focused, manageable, and independently assessable

---

### 4. Resolved Redundancy

**T28.G5.01.02 vs T28.G5.07** - Clarified distinction:

- **G5.07**: Generalized frequency analysis for various simulation types (spinners, cards, random walks), comparing distributions from different scenarios
- Added T28.G5.06 as additional dependency to G5.07

**Impact**: Clear differentiation, no redundant assessment burden

---

### 5. Added Missing Scaffolding

**T28.G4.08** (New transition skill):
- Understand compound events through examples
- Analyzes compound events (2 dice, 2 coins, spinner twice)
- Creates list of all possible combinations (36 outcomes for dice)
- Notices frequency patterns conceptually (before coding in G5)

**Updated T28.G5.01.01** to depend on T28.G4.08

**Impact**: Smooth transition from single events (G4) to compound event simulations (G5)

## Recommendations for Similar Topics

Based on T28 optimization, apply these patterns to other topics:

1. **Always check for K-1 foundation** - Many topics start too late
2. **Be aggressive with splitting complex skills** - Students need focused practice
3. **X-2 rule is non-negotiable** - Dependencies must stay within 2 grade levels
4. **Clarify assessment criteria for G6+** - Advanced skills need explicit rubrics
5. **Within-topic scaffolding is critical** - Add transition skills between major jumps
6. **Redundancy is subtle** - Look carefully at similar descriptions
