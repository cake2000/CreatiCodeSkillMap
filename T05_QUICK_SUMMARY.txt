VERIFICATION: ✓ All fixes applied and verified
STATUS: ✓ COMPLETE

NOTES:
- The specific issues mentioned in the request (T06.GK.04 ref, algorithm complexity refs, 
  T05.GK.03 X-2 violations) were NOT found in the current file
- This suggests the file may have been previously optimized or the issues were from a 
  different analysis version
- We found and fixed 6 actual redundant dependency issues instead
- No cross-topic dependencies exist in T05
- No X-2 violations found
- Same-grade dependencies present are intentional and allowed (sequential skills)
