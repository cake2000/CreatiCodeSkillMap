- Topics where K-2 students can achieve meaningful, grade-appropriate mastery
- Concrete, visual concepts that don't require coding environments
- Examples: T02 (algorithms with arrows), T03 (breaking tasks into parts), T13 (debugging picture sequences), T20 (pattern art), T28 (probability), T36 (ethics/careers)

**Partial Coverage Topics (5-9 skills):**
- Topics where K-2 readiness is appropriate but full mastery comes later
- Introduce foundational concepts without requiring abstract thinking
- Examples: T05 (design thinking for specific users), T07 (repetition concept separate from patterns), T31 (basic internet concepts)

**Bridge/Pre-Skills Topics (1-4 skills, G2 only):**
- Topics deferred to G3+ but where conceptual introduction helps
- Grade 2 students ready for preview concepts without coding
- Examples: T06 (events), T08 (if-then), T09 (variables as "boxes"), T10 (lists as "collections"), T12 (organizing steps), T14 (what is a game?), T21 (AI can make pictures)

---

### T12: Program Organization (2 skills, G2 only - MINIMAL)

**Why G2 Only & Minimal:**
- "Organizing code into sections" requires code to organize
- Just introducing the **idea** that steps can be grouped logically

## Dependencies & Sequencing

### Within-Topic Dependencies

Most topics follow this pattern:
- **K skills:** No dependencies (independent, can do in any order within topic)
- **G1 skills:** May depend on prior K skill (e.g., T02.G1.01 builds on T02.GK.03)
- **G2 skills:** Often depend on prior G1 skill (e.g., T02.G2.01 builds on T02.G1.03)

**Example: T02 (Representing & Tracing Algorithms)**
- T02.GK.01 → T02.GK.02 → T02.GK.03 (linear progression in K)
- T02.G1.01 (independent, new concept: grid tracing)
- T02.G1.02 (builds on G1.01: creating paths)
- T02.G1.03 (builds on G1.02: comparing algorithms)
- T02.G2.01 (builds on all G1: multiple representations)

### Cross-Topic Dependencies

**Strong Dependencies:**
- T02 (Representations) depends on T01 (Algorithms) - need sequencing first
- T13 (Debugging) depends on T01 (Algorithms) - need to understand sequences before debugging them
- T13.G2.04 depends on T02 (debugging picture algorithms requires understanding picture algorithms)
- T06, T08 (Events, Conditionals) depend on T01 (understanding sequences before understanding branching/events)
- T07 (Loops) slightly depends on T04 (Patterns) - pattern recognition helps understand repetition

**Weak/Conceptual Dependencies:**
- T03 (Decomposition) conceptually supports T12 (Program Organization)
- T05 (Design) conceptually supports T36 (Ethics/Accessibility)
- T28 (Probability) conceptually supports T21 (AI can be unpredictable)

### Recommended Sequencing for Curriculum

**Year 1 (Kindergarten):**
1. Start: T01, T04 (foundational patterns and sequences)
2. Mid: T25-T27 (data concepts - sorting, counting)
3. End: T30, T32, T36 (technology awareness, safety, ethics)

**Year 2 (Grade 1):**
1. Review T01, T04 (G1 versions)
2. Add: T02, T03, T13 (representations, decomposition, debugging)
3. Add: T20, T28 (creative coding, probability)
4. Continue: T25-T27, T30, T32, T36 (G1 versions)

**Year 3 (Grade 2):**
1. Review all prior topics (G2 versions)
2. Add Bridge Skills: T06, T08, T09, T10, T12, T14, T21 (prepare for G3 coding)
3. Add: T05, T07, T31 (design thinking, loops, internet concepts)
4. Culminate: Complex T13 skills (multi-error debugging)
