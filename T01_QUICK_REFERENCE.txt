T01 - EVERYDAY ALGORITHMS: PHASE 1 OPTIMIZATION - QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Topic: T01 - Everyday Algorithms
Total Skills: 95 (GK:8, G1:10, G2:14, G3:15, G4:12, G5:10, G6:8, G7:8, G8:10)
Status: STRONG - Minor issues requiring fixes
Overall Quality: Excellent K-8 progression with strong internal coherence

KEY FINDINGS
------------
✓ Strong progression from picture-based (K-2) to block coding (G3+)
✓ Excellent concept scaffolding (sequence → loops → conditionals → variables)
✓ Good integration of efficiency and ethics in upper grades
⚠ 5 X-2 rule violations in dependencies (HIGH PRIORITY)
⚠ Missing picture-to-block transition skill at G2 (HIGH PRIORITY)
⚠ Some descriptions need clarification (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
⚠ One skill too broad and needs splitting (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED (Must Do)
----------------------------------

1. FIX X-2 VIOLATIONS (5 skills)

   T01.G3.13: Remove T09.G3.01 dependency
   - Keep only: T06.G3.01
   - Reason: Sequence debugging doesn't need variables

   T01.G3.14: Remove T09.G3.01 dependency
   - Keep only: T07.G3.01
   - Reason: Loop debugging doesn't need variables

   T01.G3.15: Remove T09.G3.01 dependency
   - Keep only: T08.G3.01
   - Reason: Conditional debugging doesn't need variables

   T01.G7.01: Update dependencies to G6-G7 range
   - Change: T06.G5.01 → T06.G6.01 or T06.G7.01
   - Change: T09.G5.01 → T09.G6.01 or T09.G7.01
   - Action: Verify appropriate skills exist in T06 and T09

   T01.G8.10: Update dependencies to G7-G8 range
   - Change: T06.G6.01 → T06.G7.01 or T06.G8.01
   - Action: Verify custom blocks requirement

2. ADD MISSING TRANSITIONAL SKILL

   NEW: T01.G2.15 - Match picture instructions to visual block commands
   - Bridges picture-based (K-2) to block-coding (G3+)
   - Students match arrow cards to equivalent block commands
   - Depends on: T01.G2.13

3. IMPROVE KEY DESCRIPTIONS (6 skills)

   T01.G1.03: Add concrete routine examples
   T01.G1.04: Differentiate story vs routine prediction
   T01.G1.09: Specify multiple-goal matching challenge
   T01.GK.08: Clarify picture-based counting (no numerals)
   T01.G3.03: Specify concrete project contexts
   T01.G4.12: Provide explicit comparison criteria

4. SPLIT OVERLY BROAD SKILL

   T01.G5.02 → T01.G5.02.01 (flowchart) + T01.G5.02.02 (pseudocode)
   - Reason: Two different translation skills
   - Benefit: More targeted practice and assessment

SECONDARY ACTIONS (Should Do)
------------------------------

5. CLARIFICATIONS
   - T01.G6.01: Change title to match qualitative description
   - T01.G3.12: Review T14.G3.01 dependency necessity

6. CROSS-TOPIC VERIFICATION
   - Check T02 for flowchart/pseudocode introduction timing
   - Verify T06 has appropriate G6-G7 skills for dependencies
   - Verify T09 has appropriate G6-G7 skills for dependencies

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (Future Consideration)
---------------------------------------------

7. EXPAND G6-G7 CONTENT
   - Currently thinner than other grades (8 skills vs 10-15)
   - Consider: More search/sort algorithms, optimization patterns

8. ADD RECURSIVE THINKING SCAFFOLDING
   - NEW: T01.G7.09 - Recognize recursive patterns
   - Prepares for G8.04-05 conceptual recursion

PROGRESSION STRENGTHS BY GRADE
-------------------------------

Kindergarten (GK): Order → Identify → Predict → Fix → Pattern → Count
Grade 1 (G1): Longer sequences, missing steps, comparison, if/then concept
Grade 2 (G2): Repeat patterns, conditionals, grid navigation, [NEW: blocks]
Grade 3 (G3): Block coding, loops in code, if/then in code, debugging
Grade 4 (G4): Planning, patterns, variables, efficiency comparison
Grade 5 (G5): Flowcharts/pseudocode, correctness, edge cases, refactoring
Grade 6 (G6): Search efficiency, ethics/fairness, flowchart design
Grade 7 (G7): Algorithm patterns, testing, edge cases, refactoring
Grade 8 (G8): Simulation, recursion (conceptual), ethics, code quality

CROSS-TOPIC DEPENDENCIES SUMMARY
---------------------------------

T01 receives scaffolding from:
- T02 (Planning): Flowcharts, pseudocode [verify and add explicit dependencies]
- T04 (Patterns): Pattern recognition for repeat identification
- T06 (Projects): Basic scripting, project structure
- T07 (Loops): Counted repeat, loop constructs
- T08 (Conditionals): If/then, Boolean logic
- T09 (Variables): Variable creation, tracking state
- T14 (Input): Keyboard controls [review necessity]

All dependencies appropriate except X-2 violations (being fixed).

QUALITY METRICS
---------------

Internal Coherence: EXCELLENT
- Clear progression within each grade
- Concepts build systematically
- Good spiral structure across K-8

Grade Appropriateness: EXCELLENT (after fixes)
- K-2: Picture-based, concrete, 3-5 items
- G3: Smooth transition to blocks
- G4-5: Formal methods, correctness
- G6-8: Advanced concepts, ethics

Dependency Structure: GOOD (after fixes)
- 5 X-2 violations identified and fixed
- Cross-topic dependencies appropriate
- Clear prerequisite chains

Skill Clarity: GOOD (after improvements)
- Most descriptions clear and actionable
- 6 descriptions enhanced for specificity
- Implementation notes mostly consistent

Platform Alignment: EXCELLENT
- All required blocks available in CreatiCode
- No platform-specific concerns
- Focus on algorithmic thinking, not platform features

RISK ASSESSMENT
----------------

HIGH RISK if not addressed:
- X-2 violations could block curriculum implementation
- Missing G2-G3 bridge could cause student confusion

MEDIUM RISK if not addressed:
- Vague descriptions may lead to inconsistent implementation
- Overly broad skills may overwhelm students

LOW RISK:
- All other identified issues
- Can be refined iteratively

RECOMMENDATION
--------------

PROCEED with Phase 1A and 1B fixes before implementation.
Phase 1C refinements and Phase 2 coordination can happen during implementation.

T01 is a strong topic with excellent pedagogical design. The identified issues
are minor and can be addressed quickly. Once fixed, T01 will provide solid
algorithmic thinking foundation for the entire K-8 curriculum.
