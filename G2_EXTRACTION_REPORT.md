## Dependency Analysis

### Dependencies by Grade Level

Total dependencies across all 88 G2 skills:

- **Kindergarten (GK) dependencies:** 17
- **Grade 1 (G1) dependencies:** 74
- **Grade 2 (G2) dependencies:** 27

### Most Common Dependencies

**Top G1 Dependency:**
- **T01.G1.01** - "Put pictures in order to plant a seed" (appears in 21 G2 skills)
- **T01.G1.10** - "Match pictures to 'if/then' rules" (appears in 7 G2 skills)

**Top GK Dependency:**
- **T01.GK.07** - "Find the pattern that repeats" (appears in 6 G2 skills)
- **T01.GK.08** - "Count how many times" (appears in 3 G2 skills)

### Dependency Validation

**GOOD NEWS:** No dependency issues found!

All G2 skills only depend on:
- GK (Kindergarten) skills
- G1 (Grade 1) skills
- Other G2 (Grade 2) skills

**No G2 skills depend on higher grade levels (G3, G4, G5, etc.)**

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Foundation Skills Pattern

Many G2 skills across different topics depend on the same foundational G1 skill:
- **T01.G1.01** (Put pictures in order to plant a seed) is used as a dependency in 24% of all G2 skills
- This suggests T01.G1.01 is a critical prerequisite skill

### 2. Topic Concentration

The largest concentration of G2 skills is in:
1. **T01 – Everyday Algorithms** (14 skills - 16% of all G2 skills)
2. **T02 – Algorithm Diagrams** (6 skills)
3. **T14 – 2D Games** (5 skills)

### 3. Self-References

27 dependencies are G2-to-G2 within the same grade level, indicating:
- Progressive skill building within Grade 2
- Skills build on earlier G2 skills within same topic area

### 4. Skills with No Dependencies

Skills with 0 dependencies would need to be verified (not shown in dependency analysis section).

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review T01.G1.01 carefully** - This skill is a critical dependency for 21 other G2 skills across multiple topics
2. **Check for circular dependencies** within G2-to-G2 references
3. **Verify skills with no dependencies** - Some skills may be missing prerequisite dependencies
4. **Review cross-topic dependencies** - Ensure dependencies make logical sense across topic boundaries
5. **Consider dependency depth** - Some skills may have long dependency chains (GK → G1 → G2 → G2)
