## Instructional Recommendations by Grade

### General Pacing Guidelines
- **Grade 1-2**: 2-3 topics per semester, heavy unplugged work
- **Grade 3**: 4 core topics (fundamentals), transition to code
- **Grade 4-5**: 5-6 topics, mix of core + application
- **Grade 6-8**: 3-5 topics (students choose specialization)

### Skill Depth Recommendations
- Each skill: 2-4 lessons (30-180 minutes total)
- Skills practice: 2-3 practice problems per skill
- Integrated projects: 1 per unit (4-6 weeks)

### Teaching Progression Within a Topic
1. **Unplugged introduction** (if Grade 1-3)
2. **Guided practice** with examples and templates
3. **Scaffolded practice** with less guidance
4. **Independent practice** with student choice
5. **Application** in a project

## Important Notes for All Grades

1. **Differentiation**: Not all students progress at the same rate. Advanced students can move to next grade; students needing support can deepen current grade.

2. **Cross-Topic Connections**: Many skills build on skills from other topics. Use [Critical Pathways](CRITICAL_PATHWAYS.md) to understand these connections.

3. **Student Interest**: Let student interest guide specialization (especially Grades 6-8). A motivated student working on games will learn more than a disengaged student in a mandated topic.

4. **Assessment**: Use the skill mastery approach. Track which skills students have mastered, not just letter grades.

5. **Time Flexibility**: These timelines assume ~150-200 minutes per week of CS instruction. Adjust based on your context.
