SUMMARY
================================================================================

G4 skills requiring fixes: 37
G4 skills without issues: 125

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review all FORWARD REFERENCES (HIGH priority) - these are critical errors
2. Fix RANGE VIOLATIONS by:
   - Replacing GK/G1 dependencies with intermediate G2/G3 skills from same topic
   - Or adding the intermediate skills as dependencies
3. Verify that all G4 skills have appropriate prerequisites
4. Consider creating intermediate skills if gaps exist in the progression
