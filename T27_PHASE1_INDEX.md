## KEY FINDINGS SNAPSHOT

### What's Working Well ✓
- K-2 progression (unplugged, age-appropriate)
- Storytelling integration throughout
- Ethical awareness in G7-G8 (fairness, bias)
- AI integration concepts (G6-G8)
- Overall conceptual structure

### Critical Problems ❌
1. Missing table creation foundation (G3)
2. Platform mismatches (scatter plots, aggregation approach)
3. Filtering skill too late (G6 instead of G3-4)
4. Median/mode scaffolding gap (concept before code)
5. Vague block references (multiple skills)
6. Major platform capabilities unused (60% of blocks)

### Top Recommendations
1. **ADD**: 10 new skills for scaffolding
2. **REWRITE**: 8 existing skills for platform alignment
3. **FIX**: 7+ dependency errors
4. **ENHANCE**: Block specificity in descriptions
5. **RESULT**: 38 skills with 47% platform coverage

## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Why 10 new skills instead of just fixing existing ones?
**Answer**: Analysis revealed CRITICAL gaps in scaffolding. Students cannot complete existing G3+ skills without foundational knowledge (table creation, filtering, sorting). Adding these skills is required, not optional.

### Why not delete any skills?
**Answer**: Phase 1 rules specify PRESERVE all skills, NEVER delete. All current skills have value; they just need fixes or prerequisites added.

### Why focus on platform blocks so much?
**Answer**: T27 currently uses only 16-21% of CreatiCode's 62+ data/visualization blocks. This is a missed opportunity. Students pay for full platform but learn fraction of capabilities.

### What happens in Phase 2?
**Answer**: Phase 2 will review cross-topic dependencies (T25→T27, T26→T27, etc.) to ensure proper integration across the data analysis pipeline. Phase 1 deliberately ignored these to focus on T27 internal quality.

### Can we implement partially?
**Answer**: YES, but follow wave prioritization. Wave 1 (critical fixes) is REQUIRED. Waves 2-4 add increasing value but aren't blockers. Minimum viable: Wave 1 + Wave 2.

### How confident is this analysis?
**Answer**: VERY CONFIDENT. Based on:
- Complete read of skills_T27_data_analysis.md (28 skills)
- Complete read of allskills.md T27 section
- Complete analysis of 62+ CreatiCode blocks
- Platform documentation from blockdes8.txt
- 20+ example programs validated
