================================================================================

ID: T10.G3.01.01
Skill: Create a new list variable

Description:
Students create a new list variable in the Variables palette by clicking "Make a List" and giving it a descriptive name (e.g., "fruits", "scores", "inventory"). Lists are containers that can hold multiple values, unlike regular variables which hold only one value. Students recognize that this is the first step before any list operations can be performed, and verify the empty list appears in the Variables palette.

Dependencies:
  * T09.G3.01.01: Create a new variable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.01.02
Skill: Add an item to the end of a list

Description:
Students use the `add [item] to [list]` block to add items one at a time to the end of a list. They observe how each item is added in sequence (1, 2, 3...) and note that lists grow dynamically as items are added. Students practice adding 3-4 items and use the list monitor to verify the growing list.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.01: Create a new list variable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.02
Skill: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)

Description:
Students use the `item (1) of [list]` block to retrieve specific items from a list by their position number (index). The first item is at position 1, second at position 2, etc. Students practice reading different positions and displaying or using the retrieved values, verifying the correct item is returned.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.03
Skill: Get the length of a list

Description:
Students use the `length of [list]` block to find how many items are in a list. They observe that as items are added or removed, the length changes accordingly. This is essential for knowing the bounds when accessing list items and avoiding out-of-range errors.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.04.01
Skill: Delete an item at a specific position

Description:
Students use the `delete (position) of [list]` block to remove an item from a specific position in the list. They observe how items after the deleted position shift down (e.g., item 3 becomes item 2) and verify that the list length decreases by 1. Students practice deleting items from different positions (beginning, middle, end) and predict the resulting list state.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
  * T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.04.02
Skill: Clear all items from a list

Description:
Students use the `delete all of [list]` block to remove every item from a list at once, returning it to empty. Clearing is useful for starting fresh or resetting for a new game. Students observe that after clearing, the list length becomes 0 and verify the list monitor shows an empty list.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
  * T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.05
Skill: Loop through each item in a list

Description:
Students use the `for each [item] in [list]` block to automatically visit every item in sequence. Unlike counted repeat loops where you specify a number of repetitions, this block iterates through all items regardless of list length. Students perform simple actions on each item (e.g., say each fruit name) and observe that every item is processed exactly once. Keep the list short (3-4 items) and actions simple.

Dependencies:
  * T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.06
Skill: Check if a list contains a specific item

Description:
Students use the `[list] contains [item]?` block to check whether a value exists in a list. They combine this with conditionals to make decisions based on list membership (e.g., "if my fruits list contains 'apple' then say 'I have an apple!'"). Students test with items that are in the list and items that are not.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T08.G3.04: Use a simple if in a script

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.07
Skill: Count items in a list that match a condition

Description:
Students loop through a short list and count items that match a simple condition (e.g., "count numbers greater than 5" or "count items equal to 'apple'"). They use a counter variable that increments inside a conditional inside a loop. Students predict the count before running and verify their prediction matches the result.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
  * T08.G3.04: Use a simple if in a script
  * T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.08
Skill: Check if a list is empty before accessing

Description:
Students check whether a list is empty (has zero items) before trying to read from it, to avoid errors. They use the `length of [list] = 0` condition in an if-statement to guard list access. This defensive programming pattern prevents crashes when dealing with lists that might be empty.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list
  * T08.G3.04: Use a simple if in a script

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.09
Skill: Increment or decrement a list item's value

Description:
Students use the `change item (position) of [list] by (amount)` block to modify numeric values in a list arithmetically (e.g., increase a player's score by 10, decrease health by 5). This block changes the value in place without needing to manually get-calculate-replace, making score updates and counters much simpler. For young learners who don't know negative numbers, the `reduce item (position) of [list] by (amount)` block provides a simpler way to decrease values. Students verify the change by reading the item before and after modification.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
  * T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable

Skill: Display a list monitor on the stage

Description:
Students enable the list monitor by checking the checkbox next to the list name in the Variables palette. The monitor displays all items with their positions (1, 2, 3...) and updates in real-time as items are added, removed, or changed. Students use visual feedback to verify list state and debug their programs by watching the monitor while running code.

ID: T10.G3.11
Skill: Predict and trace list changes step by step

Description:
Students trace through a short sequence of list operations (3-5 blocks) and predict the final state of the list. Given blocks like: create list → add "apple" → add "banana" → delete item 1 → add "cherry", students write down what the list contains after each step and predict the final result ["banana", "cherry"]. This builds mental models of how lists work and prepares students for debugging. Students verify predictions by running the code and comparing actual vs expected results.

ID: T10.G3.12
Skill: Debug a list program by identifying wrong positions

Description:
Students identify and fix bugs in list programs where items are accessed, inserted, or deleted at wrong positions. Given a buggy program that should add items to a shopping cart but produces incorrect results, students use step-by-step execution and list monitors to find where positions are off-by-one or incorrect. They practice common debugging patterns: verifying list contents after each operation, checking that indices are within bounds (1 to length), and understanding how deletions shift subsequent items.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.11: Predict and trace list changes step by step
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.13
Skill: Use a list to store user inputs

Description:
Students create interactive programs that collect multiple inputs from users and store them in a list. They use the `ask and wait` block inside a loop to gather several responses (e.g., "Enter 3 favorite foods"), adding each answer to a list. After collection, they display or process the collected data, such as saying all items back to the user. This introduces the practical pattern of building lists dynamically from user interaction rather than hardcoding values.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.14
Skill: Explain to a partner why a list is useful for a problem

Description:
Students explain their choice to use a list rather than separate variables. Given a scenario (e.g., "store 5 quiz scores"), they articulate to a partner or record: "I used a list because I have MANY similar items, and with a list I can add more items easily, loop through all items, and keep them organized together. If I used 5 separate variables, I couldn't easily add a 6th score or loop through them." Students practice explaining trade-offs: lists are better for collections of similar items, but single variables are fine for one or two distinct values. This communication skill is essential for collaborative programming and code reviews.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G3.15
Skill: Choose list or variables for a simple data storage problem

Description:
Students analyze a data storage scenario and decide whether to use a list or separate variables. Scenarios include: (A) "Store a player's name, score, and level" → 3 separate variables (different types of data), (B) "Store the names of 10 students" → list (many similar items), (C) "Store whether sound is on or off" → single variable (just one value). Students justify their choice and recognize patterns: lists are for "many of the same kind," variables are for "few different things." This decision-making skill prepares students for designing more complex data solutions.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.01: Create a new list variable
  * T09.G3.01.01: Create a new variable

ID: T10.G4.01.01
Skill: Find an item's position using built-in block

Description:
Students use the `item # of [value] in [list]` block to find the position of a value in a list. They understand this returns the index of the first occurrence (or 0 if not found) and practice searching for items in different lists.

Dependencies:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.01.02
Skill: Implement manual linear search with loop

Description:
Students implement a simple linear search algorithm by looping through a list, comparing each item to a target value, and reporting the position when found (or "not found" if the loop completes). They use a counter variable for the position and a conditional to check each item. This foundational algorithm skill teaches sequential searching and how the built-in block works internally.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
  * T08.G3.04: Use a simple if in a script
  * T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.02
Skill: Store and retrieve parallel list data

Description:
Students use two lists in parallel (e.g., "playerNames" and "playerScores") where items at the same index are related. They add items to both lists together and use the same index to retrieve matching data (e.g., "the player at index 2 in names has the score at index 2 in scores"). Students recognize that keeping parallel lists synchronized is critical—adding to one requires adding to the other at the same position.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.03
Skill: Insert an item at a specific position in a list

Description:
Students use the `insert [item] at (position) of [list]` block to add items at the beginning, middle, or end of a list. They observe how existing items shift to higher indices to make room and verify the new item appears at the correct position. Students practice inserting at position 1 (prepend), at length+1 (append), and at middle positions.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
  * T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.04
Skill: Replace an item in a list

Description:
Students use the `replace item (position) of [list] with [value]` block to update an existing item without changing the list length. They practice replacing items based on position and recognize the difference between replacing (overwrites in place, same length) and inserting (shifts existing items, length increases).

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.05
Skill: Use built-in blocks to sort a list

Description:
Students use CreatiCode's `sort list [list] from [large to small/small to large]` block to sort numeric or alphabetic lists. They observe how the order changes and note that sorting rearranges items by value. Students verify the sort by reading the first and last items to confirm the order direction.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.06.01: Find the smallest value in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.06.04
Skill: Calculate the average of values in a list

Description:
Students use the `[average v] of list [list]` block to find the mean of all numeric values. Average represents a typical/central value and equals sum divided by length. Students apply this to practical scenarios like grade averages, temperature averages, and game score averages.

Dependencies:

  * T10.G4.06.03: Calculate the sum of all values in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.06.05
Skill: Find the median value in a list

Description:
Students use the `[median v] of list [list]` block to find the middle value when sorted. Median differs from average because it is less affected by outliers. Students identify scenarios where median is more useful than average (income data, test scores with extreme values) by comparing both measures on lists with outliers.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
  * T10.G4.06.04: Calculate the average of values in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.07
Skill: Find the maximum or minimum item in a list manually

Description:
Students write a loop to find the largest or smallest item in a numeric list without using built-in blocks. They initialize a "best so far" variable with the first item, loop through remaining items comparing each to the current best, and update the best when a better value is found. Students trace through a 5-item list and track how the "best so far" variable changes. This manual algorithm builds algorithmic thinking for aggregation operations.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
  * T08.G3.04: Use a simple if in a script
  * T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.08
Skill: Filter items from a list based on a condition

Description:
Students loop through a list and build a new filtered list containing only items that satisfy a condition (e.g., "keep only scores > 50"). They create an empty result list, use conditionals inside a loop to check each item, and add matching items to the result list. Students verify the filtered list contains exactly the items that match the condition.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
  * T08.G3.04: Use a simple if in a script
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.09
Skill: Build a high score list with parallel lists

Description:
Students create a leaderboard using two parallel lists (names and scores). When a new score is added, they find the correct position to insert it (to keep scores sorted in descending order) and insert both the name and score at matching positions. Students verify that the leaderboard remains sorted after each insertion.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.01.02: Implement manual linear search with loop
  * T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
  * T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.10
Skill: Swap two items in a list

Description:
Students swap the positions of two items in a list using a temporary variable. They store one item in the temp variable, replace it with the other item, then put the temp value in the second position. Students trace through the three-step swap process and verify both items exchange positions correctly. This pattern is a building block for sorting algorithms.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list
  * T09.G3.01.02: Increment and decrement a variable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.11.01
Skill: Copy one list to another (replacing contents)

Description:
Students use the `copy [list1] to [list2]` block to duplicate a list. This REPLACES all items in list2 with items from list1, so list2's original contents are lost. After copying, both lists have identical items but remain separate (changing one doesn't affect the other). Students verify independence by modifying one list and confirming the other remains unchanged.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.11.02
Skill: Append one list to another (adding to end)

Description:
Students use the `append [list1] to [list2]` block to add all items from list1 to the END of list2. This PRESERVES list2's original items and adds list1's items below them. Students compare append vs. copy and identify when each is appropriate: copy for backup/duplication, append for combining datasets.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.11.01: Copy one list to another (replacing contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.12
Skill: Split a text string into a list

Description:
Students use the `set [list] to split of [text] with splitter [delimiter]` block to convert text into a list of items (e.g., split "apple,banana,orange" by "," to get a list of three fruits). Students experiment with different delimiters (comma, space, newline) and verify the resulting list contains the expected items. This introduces text processing and list creation from external data.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.13
Skill: Join list items into a text string

Description:
Students use the `join [list] into text with [delimiter]` block to combine list items into a single text string (e.g., join ["red", "green", "blue"] with ", " to get "red, green, blue"). This is the inverse of split and is useful for displaying list contents or saving list data as text.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.12: Split a text string into a list
  * T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.14
Skill: Reverse the order of items in a list

Description:
Students use the `reverse [list]` block to flip item order (first becomes last, last becomes first). They observe the list monitor to see position changes. Reversing is useful for converting ascending to descending order, reversing time sequences, or inverting rankings.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.15
Skill: Randomly shuffle items in a list

Description:
Students use the `reshuffle [list] randomly` block to randomly rearrange all items. Each shuffle produces a different random order. Applications include shuffling cards, randomizing quiz questions, or creating random starting positions. Students note that reshuffling destroys the original order (make a copy first if needed).

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.16.01
Skill: Generate a list of random numbers with options

Description:
Students use the `set [list] to (N) random whole numbers between (min) and (max) [no repetition/allow repetition]` block to populate a list with random values. They select whether to allow duplicate numbers and apply this for generating test data, simulating dice rolls, or creating random scores.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.16.02
Skill: Generate seeded random list

Description:
Students use the seeded random block `set [list] to (N) random numbers with seed (SEED)` which generates the same sequence when using the same seed. This enables reproducible randomness for games (same level layout with same seed) and testing scenarios requiring consistent random data. Students verify that the same seed always produces the same list.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.16.01: Generate a list of random numbers with options

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.17
Skill: Delete an item from a list by value

Description:
Students use the `delete value [item] from [list]` block to remove the first occurrence of a specific value (e.g., delete "apple" from the fruits list). This finds and removes the item without needing to know its position, which differs from deleting by index. Students test with items that exist (removes first match) and items that don't exist (no change).

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
  * T10.G3.06: Check if a list contains a specific item

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.18
Skill: Loop through list indices

Description:
Students use the `for each index [i] in [list]` block to iterate through list positions (1, 2, 3...) instead of values. This is necessary when they need to know both the position and the value, or when they need to modify items while looping. Students compare index-based iteration to value-based iteration and identify use cases for each.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
  * T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.19
Skill: Find an item containing a substring

Description:
Students use the `# of item containing [substring] in [list]` block to find the first list item that includes a partial match (e.g., find first name containing "son" in a names list). Students compare exact matching (T10.G4.01.01) to partial matching and identify when each is appropriate.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.01.01: Find an item's position using built-in block
  * T09.G4.01: Use addition (+) in variable expressions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
Students use the `insert (N) [largest/smallest/random] items from [list1] into [list2]` block to extract top/bottom/random items efficiently. Applications include leaderboards (top 10 scores), random sampling (pick 5 random quiz questions), or filtering extremes (3 coldest days). Students verify results by checking that list2 contains exactly N items matching the specified criteria.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
  * T10.G4.06.01: Find the smallest value in a list
  * T10.G4.11.02: Append one list to another (adding to end)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.21
Skill: Extract a sublist from a range of positions

Description:
Students create a new list containing items from a specific range within an existing list. Using a loop from start position to end position, they read each item from the source list and add it to a new result list. For example, to extract items 3-5 from a 10-item list, they loop from 3 to 5, reading and adding each item. This pattern is useful for pagination (show items 11-20), processing chunks of data, or splitting a list into smaller pieces.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.22
Skill: Transform each item in a list using a loop

Description:
Students iterate through a list and apply a transformation to each item (e.g., double all numbers, convert all text to uppercase, add a prefix to each name). They use a loop with index access to read each item, transform it, and replace it in the same position. This pattern introduces the map operation concept where every element is processed uniformly. Students trace through a 4-item list showing the before and after state.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices
  * T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.23
Skill: Reduce a list to a single value using accumulation

Description:
Students implement the accumulator pattern to reduce a list to a single result: start with an initial value (0 for sum, 1 for product, empty string for concatenation), loop through all items, and combine each item with the accumulator. Beyond sum (already covered), students apply this pattern to compute products of all numbers, concatenate all strings, or find the longest string. This introduces the reduce/fold concept foundational to functional programming.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.05: Loop through each item in a list
  * T10.G4.06.03: Calculate the sum of all values in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.24
Skill: Predict list state after a sequence of operations

Description:
Students read a sequence of 5-7 list operations (add, delete, insert, replace) and predict the final list contents without running the code. They trace through each operation step by step, writing the list state after each step, then verify their prediction by running the code. This skill emphasizes understanding how each operation modifies the list and develops mental execution abilities critical for debugging and algorithm design.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.11: Predict and trace list changes step by step
  * T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
  * T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.25
Skill: Debug parallel list synchronization errors

Description:
Students identify and fix bugs where parallel lists become out of sync—a common error when working with related data in separate lists. Given buggy code where names and scores lists don't match up correctly (e.g., inserting into one list but not the other, or deleting at different positions), students trace through to find where synchronization breaks and fix the code. They develop the rule: "When modifying parallel lists, ALWAYS modify both at the same position." Students practice debugging scenarios: (1) adding to only one list, (2) deleting from wrong positions, (3) inserting at mismatched indices.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
  * T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
  * T10.G3.12: Debug a list program by identifying wrong positions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.26
Skill: Design a list structure for a game inventory system

Description:
Students design and implement a simple inventory system using lists. They identify what data needs to be stored (item names, quantities, maybe categories), decide between one list vs. parallel lists vs. list of formatted strings, and implement add/remove/display operations. Example: A simple game where the player collects items. Students design: items list ["sword", "shield", "potion"], quantities list [1, 1, 3]. They implement: add item (check if exists, increment or add new), remove item (decrement or remove if zero), display inventory (loop through and show). This project-based skill applies list concepts to a real game scenario.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
  * T10.G4.01.01: Find an item's position using built-in block
  * T10.G3.09: Increment or decrement a list item's value

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G4.27
Skill: Compare two lists for equality

Description:
Students write code to check if two lists contain the same items in the same order. They first check if lengths match, then loop through comparing each position. If any position differs, the lists are not equal. Students trace through comparisons and understand this is different from checking if lists have the same items in ANY order (which would require sorting or more complex checking). Applications include: verifying a copy was made correctly, checking if a shuffle changed anything, or validating user input matches expected sequence.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices
  * T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list
  * T08.G3.04: Use a simple if in a script

ID: T10.G5.01
Skill: Identify table structure (rows, columns, cells)

Description:
Students identify and label the parts of a table: rows (horizontal, numbered), columns (vertical, named), and cells (values at row-column intersections). Given a sample table, they state the number of rows and columns, identify the value at a specific row-column intersection, and explain that each row represents one record while each column represents one attribute. Students recognize that a table is like having multiple parallel lists (one list per column) organized together, where all lists have the same length and items at the same position are related. A table makes it easier to manage related data than using many separate parallel lists.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data

ID: T10.G5.02
Skill: Create a table and add columns

Description:
Students create an empty table variable and use `add column [name] at position (n) to table [table]` to define the table structure. Columns must be created before data can be added to them, and the position parameter controls column order (1 = first column, 2 = second, etc.). Students verify the table structure by examining the table monitor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.06.02
Skill: Find which row contains a value

Description:

Students use CreatiCode's `[sum/average/smallest/largest/median] of column [name] in table [table]` blocks to compute statistics on a column without writing a loop. They compare this to manual aggregation using loops from the previous skill.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.07: Loop through table rows to compute aggregates
  * T10.G4.06.01: Find the smallest value in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.09.01
Skill: Delete a single row by index

Description:
Students use the `delete row (n) of table [table]` block to remove a specific row by its position number. They observe how remaining rows shift up (row 4 becomes row 3) and understand the row count decreases by 1.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.06.01: Get the number of rows in a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.09.02
Skill: Delete rows matching a condition

Description:
Students use the `delete rows with column [name] of value [v] from table [table]` block to remove ALL rows where a specific column equals a value. They understand this can delete multiple rows at once (e.g., delete all students in grade 8) and is more efficient than looping to delete one by one.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.09.01: Delete a single row by index
  * T10.G5.06.02: Find which row contains a value

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.09.03
Skill: Clear all rows from a table

Description:
Students use the `delete all rows from table [table]` block to remove all data while preserving the column structure. They understand this is useful for resetting a table for new data without recreating columns, and compare this to deleting entire table vs. just clearing data.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.09.01: Delete a single row by index

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.10
Skill: Convert between lists and tables

Description:

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.11.01
Skill: Add a column at a specific position

Description:
Students use the `add column [name] at position (n) to table [table]` block to insert a new column at a specific position (1 = first column, 2 = second, etc.). They understand existing columns shift right to make room, and the new column starts empty. They practice adding columns at beginning, middle, and end.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.02: Create a table and add columns

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.11.02
Skill: Delete a single column

Description:
Students use the `delete column [name] from table [table]` block to permanently remove a column and ALL its data. They understand this cannot be undone, remaining columns shift left, and the table structure changes. They identify when column deletion is appropriate vs. just clearing cell values.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.11.01: Add a column at a specific position
  * T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.11.03
Skill: Remove all columns from a table

Description:
Students use the `delete all columns from table [table]` block to completely reset a table to empty structure (no columns, no rows). They understand this is more destructive than deleting all rows (which keeps columns) and use this when completely restructuring a table.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.11.02: Delete a single column

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.12
Skill: Copy list data to table column

Description:
Students use the `copy list [list] to column [name] of table [table]` block to populate or replace an entire column with list values. They understand this requires the column to already exist and will overwrite existing data in that column.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.02: Create a table and add columns
  * T10.G3.01.02: Add an item to the end of a list
  * T10.G5.10: Convert between lists and tables

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.13
Skill: Insert a row at a specific position

Description:
Students use `insert at row (n) of table [table]: [cell1] [cell2] ...` to add a row at a specific position, shifting existing rows down. They understand the difference between appending (always adds at end) and inserting (can add anywhere).

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table
  * T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.14
Skill: Replace an entire row in a table

Description:
Students use `replace row (n) of table [table] with: [cell1] [cell2] ...` to overwrite all values in a row at once. They compare this to updating individual cells (T10.G5.05) and understand when replacing entire rows is more efficient.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.05: Update a cell value in a table
  * T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.15
Skill: Get an entire row as a text string

Description:
Students use `row (n) of table [table] separator [sep]` to extract all values from a row as a single text string with specified separator. They use this to display row data, save row snapshots, or pass row data to other parts of the program. They understand this returns text (e.g., "apple,banana,orange"), not a list data structure.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
  * T10.G5.10: Convert between lists and tables
  * T10.G4.12: Split a text string into a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.16
Skill: Find a row by partial match

Description:
Students use `row # of item containing [substring] in column [name] in table [table]` to find the first row where a column value includes a substring (e.g., find student with "son" in last name). They compare exact vs partial matching.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.06.02: Find which row contains a value
  * T10.G4.19: Find an item containing a substring

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.17
Skill: Increment or decrement a table cell value

Description:
Students use `change item at row (n) column [name] of table [table] by (amount)` to modify numeric cell values arithmetically (e.g., increase a player's score by 10, decrease inventory by 3). For young learners, the `reduce item at row (n) column [name] of table [table] by (amount)` block provides a simpler way to decrease values without negative numbers. Students compare this to replacement (T10.G5.05) and recognize when arithmetic modification is more efficient than get-calculate-replace patterns.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.05: Update a cell value in a table
  * T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
  * T10.G3.09: Increment or decrement a list item's value

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.18
Skill: Show and hide table monitors

Description:
Students use `show table [table]` and `hide table [table]` blocks to display or hide the table monitor on the stage. Applications include debugging programs by observing table state, showing results to users, or hiding implementation details during gameplay.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.02: Create a table and add columns
  * T09.G3.01.04: Display variable value on stage using the variable monitor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.19
Skill: Build a filtered table manually using conditionals

Description:
Students create a new table containing only rows that match a specific condition by looping through the source table and using if-statements. For each row, they check if a column value meets a criterion (e.g., score > 80), and if so, add that row to a result table. This manual filtering approach builds the algorithmic thinking needed before using advanced built-in filter operations in Grade 6. Students trace through 5-7 sample rows and verify their filtered result contains exactly the matching rows.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.06.01: Get the number of rows in a table
  * T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
  * T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table
  * T08.G4.03: Combine two conditions with AND

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.20
Skill: Debug table programs by tracing row and column access

Description:
Students identify and fix bugs in table programs where cells are accessed at wrong row-column combinations, rows are skipped in loops, or data is written to incorrect positions. Given a buggy program that should update a student gradebook but produces incorrect results, students use step-by-step execution and table monitors to trace which cells are being read or written. They practice common debugging patterns: logging row/column indices during loops, verifying cell values match expectations, and checking loop bounds against row count.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
  * T10.G5.07: Loop through table rows to compute aggregates
  * T10.G3.12: Debug a list program by identifying wrong positions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.21
Skill: Compare values across two columns in the same row

Description:
Students write programs that compare values in different columns of the same row to make decisions or compute derived values. Examples: compare "budget" and "spent" columns to find rows that are over budget, compare "expected" and "actual" columns to calculate differences, or compare "score1" and "score2" columns to determine which is higher. Students loop through rows, read both column values, apply comparison logic, and either flag rows, update a third column, or count matches.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table
  * T10.G5.07: Loop through table rows to compute aggregates
  * T08.G4.03: Combine two conditions with AND

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.22
Skill: Compare tables vs parallel lists and justify choice

Description:
Students analyze scenarios and decide whether parallel lists or a table is the better data structure, then justify their choice. Comparison factors: (1) Tables keep related data visibly together, making it harder to accidentally desynchronize; (2) Tables have built-in lookup and aggregate operations; (3) Parallel lists may be simpler for very basic needs. Given scenarios like "track 3 properties for 20 students," students explain: "A table is better because all student data stays in one row—I can't accidentally add a name without adding a score. Plus I can sort the whole table by any column." Students practice articulating trade-offs to a partner or in writing.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.01: Identify table structure (rows, columns, cells)
  * T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.23
Skill: Model a real-world scenario with table schema design

Description:
Students design a table structure to model a real-world scenario they choose (or are given). Steps: (1) Identify what "things" need to be tracked (these become rows), (2) Identify what properties each thing has (these become columns), (3) Choose appropriate column names, (4) Add sample data to verify the design works. Example scenarios: classroom seating chart, pet adoption records, library book tracking, sports team roster. Students present their design, explain why they chose those columns, and demonstrate with 3-5 sample rows. This design-thinking skill prepares students for database modeling.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.02: Create a table and add columns
  * T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G5.24
Skill: Verify table operations produce expected results

Description:
Students develop verification habits by checking that table operations produce correct results. Verification techniques: (1) Check row count before and after operations (did add increase by 1? did delete decrease by 1?), (2) Read back a cell value after updating to confirm the change, (3) Use table monitors to visually verify state, (4) Test edge cases (empty table, single row, first/last row operations). Given a table operation to perform, students write verification code that confirms the operation succeeded. This defensive programming skill prevents silent bugs in data manipulation.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.06.01: Get the number of rows in a table
  * T10.G5.05: Update a cell value in a table
  * T10.G5.18: Show and hide table monitors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GRADE 6 (22 skills)
================================================================================

ID: T10.G6.01
Skill: Sort a table by a column

Description:
Students use CreatiCode's `sort table [table] by column [name] [large to small/small to large]` block to reorder rows based on values in a column. They understand sorting preserves row integrity (all columns in a row stay together). Students verify the sort worked by reading cell values before and after.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
  * T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.02
Skill: Filter table rows based on a condition

Description:
Students loop through a table and identify rows where a column value meets a condition (e.g., "find all students with score > 80"). They collect matching row numbers into a list or build a new filtered table containing only matching rows. Students verify their filter by checking that all rows in the result satisfy the condition.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.19: Build a filtered table manually using conditionals
  * T08.G5.02: Use compound conditions with and/or/not

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.03
Skill: Copy and append tables

Description:
Students use `copy table [t1] into [t2]` to duplicate a table and `append table [t1] to [t2]` to combine tables vertically. Vertical appending adds new rows below existing rows; both tables must have matching columns for append to work correctly.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.04
Skill: Use table lookup to find related data

Description:
Students use the `item in column [return_col] of [table] where column [search_col] equals [value]` block to look up data. For example, find a student's grade by looking up their name, similar to VLOOKUP in spreadsheets.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.06.02: Find which row contains a value
  * T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.05
Skill: Group data and compute aggregates per group

Description:
Students use CreatiCode's `set table [result] to [method] of column [value_col] in table [source] by column [group_col]` block to group rows by a category and compute statistics (sum, average, count) for each group, creating a summary table.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.08: Use built-in table aggregate blocks
  * T10.G6.02: Filter table rows based on a condition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.06
Skill: Use set operations on lists

Description:
Students implement set operations like union (all unique items from both lists), intersection (only items in both lists), and difference (items in list1 but not list2) using loops and conditionals. They understand mathematical set concepts applied to lists.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.08: Filter items from a list based on a condition
  * T10.G3.06: Check if a list contains a specific item

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.07
Skill: Remove duplicate items from a list

Description:
Students write code to remove duplicate values from a list, keeping only one instance of each unique value. They loop through the list, check if each item already exists in a result list, and add only unique items.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G3.06: Check if a list contains a specific item
  * T10.G4.08: Filter items from a list based on a condition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.08
Skill: Shuffle table rows randomly

Description:
Students use the `reshuffle table [table] randomly` block to randomize row order while keeping row integrity (all columns in a row stay together). Applications include randomizing quiz questions stored in tables, shuffling game data, or anonymizing datasets for privacy.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.15: Randomly shuffle items in a list
  * T10.G5.03: Add rows of data to a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.09
Skill: Create and populate a nested list (2D array)

Description:
Students create a list where each item is itself a list, forming a 2D grid structure. For example, a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board can be represented as a list of 3 rows, where each row is a list of 3 cells. Students create the structure by making an outer list, then adding inner lists as items. They populate cells by first accessing the inner list, then setting items within it. This introduces the concept of nested data structures as an alternative to tables for grid-based data.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
  * T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
  * T10.G4.04: Replace an item in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.10
Skill: Access elements in a nested list using row and column indices

Description:
Students read and write values in a 2D list using two indices: first to select the row (outer list item), then to select the column (inner list item). For example, to get the value at row 2, column 3 of a grid, they use `item 3 of (item 2 of grid)`. Students practice navigating the nested structure and recognize that accessing requires two steps: outer index first, then inner index.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G6.09: Create and populate a nested list (2D array)
  * T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.11
Skill: Iterate through all elements of a 2D array with nested loops

Description:
Students use nested loops to visit every cell in a 2D array: the outer loop iterates through rows (1 to number of rows), and the inner loop iterates through columns (1 to number of columns in that row). For each cell, they perform an operation like summing values, finding the maximum, or checking for a condition. Students trace through a 3x3 grid and predict the order in which cells are visited (row-major order).

Dependencies:
  * T10.G6.10: Access elements in a nested list using row and column indices
  * T07.G6.01: Trace nested loops with variable bounds

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.12
Skill: Implement queue operations (enqueue and dequeue)

Description:
Students implement queue behavior using a list: enqueue (add to end), dequeue (remove and return first item), and peek (read first item without removing). They use `add [item] to [queue]` for enqueue, `item (1) of [queue]` with `delete (1) of [queue]` for dequeue, and recognize FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior. Applications include task queues (process tasks in order received), print queues, breadth-first traversal, and simulating waiting lines. Students contrast FIFO (queue) with LIFO (stack) behavior by tracing the same operations on both data structures.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.03: Insert an item at a specific position in a list
  * T10.G3.04.01: Delete an item at a specific position
  * T10.G3.03: Get the length of a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.13
Skill: Use frequency counting with lists

Description:
Students count occurrences of each unique value in a list by using parallel lists (one for unique values, one for counts). They loop through the source list, check if each item exists in the values list, and either increment its count or add a new entry. This technique enables finding the most/least frequent items, creating histograms, and analyzing data distributions. Students apply this to real scenarios like counting votes, tallying survey responses, or finding the mode of a dataset.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
  * T10.G4.01.01: Find an item's position using built-in block
  * T10.G3.09: Increment or decrement a list item's value

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.14
Skill: Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list

Description:
Students implement the merge algorithm: given two already-sorted lists, combine them into one sorted list without re-sorting. They use two pointers (one for each list), repeatedly compare the current items, add the smaller one to the result, and advance that pointer. This O(n) algorithm is more efficient than concatenating and re-sorting O(n log n), and is a building block for merge sort. Students trace through merging [1, 4, 7] and [2, 3, 8] step by step.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.05: Use built-in blocks to sort a list
  * T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices
  * T10.G3.08: Check if a list is empty before accessing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.15
Skill: Swap adjacent items based on comparison

Description:
Students practice the swap pattern in the context of sorting: compare two adjacent items, swap them if out of order, and recognize that multiple passes are needed to fully sort. They trace through swapping adjacent pairs and observe how items gradually move toward correct positions. This builds directly toward implementing bubble sort and selection sort algorithms in Grade 8.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.10: Swap two items in a list
  * T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.16
Skill: Find maximum in a sublist range

Description:
Students extend the manual find-max algorithm (T10.G4.07) to find the maximum or minimum within a specific range of indices, not the entire list. They loop from a start position to an end position, tracking the best value and its position. This pattern is essential for selection sort (find min in remaining unsorted portion) and other range-based algorithms.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.07: Find the maximum or minimum item in a list manually
  * T10.G4.21: Extract a sublist from a range of positions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.17
Skill: Parse text into structured list data

Description:
Students use text splitting and string operations to parse semi-structured text (like CSV lines, simple log entries, or formatted strings) into list items for programmatic processing. They use the split block to break text by delimiters, handle edge cases like extra spaces, and build lists from parsed text. This bridges text manipulation and list operations, preparing for complex data parsing in Grade 8.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.12: Split a text string into a list
  * T10.G4.08: Filter items from a list based on a condition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.18
Skill: Select a random item from a list

Description:
Students use the `item (random v) of [list]` block or generate a random index using `pick random (1) to (length of [list])` to select items at random. Applications include picking random quiz questions, selecting random game events, or implementing simple random sampling. Students verify that multiple runs produce different selections and understand the difference between random access and sequential access.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G4.18: Loop through list indices
  * T10.G4.15: Randomly shuffle items in a list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.19
Skill: Filter table rows using OR conditions

Description:
Students extend filtering to OR conditions, finding rows that match ANY of several criteria. For example, "find all students who scored above 90 OR are in grade 8" requires checking two conditions and including the row if EITHER is true. Students implement this with `if <condition1> or <condition2>` inside a loop, understanding that OR is more inclusive than AND (more rows match). They compare results: AND filtering returns fewer rows (must meet ALL conditions), OR filtering returns more rows (must meet ANY condition). Applications include searching for records that could match multiple categories.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G6.02: Filter table rows based on a condition
  * T08.G5.02: Use compound conditions with and/or/not

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.20
Skill: Choose between filtering and sorting for a data task

Description:
Students analyze data tasks and decide whether filtering, sorting, or both is the appropriate operation. Decision framework: Filtering REMOVES rows that don't match (when you only want certain items), Sorting REORDERS all rows (when you want everything but in a different order), Sometimes you need both (filter first, then sort the results). Given scenarios: (1) "Show only students who passed" → Filter, (2) "Show all students ranked by score" → Sort, (3) "Show the top 5 highest scores" → Sort then take first 5 (or filter by threshold). Students justify their operation choice and implement the solution.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G6.02: Filter table rows based on a condition
  * T10.G6.01: Sort a table by a column

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.21
Skill: Verify data transformation correctness

Description:
Students develop verification strategies for data transformations: after filtering, sorting, or aggregating, how do you know the result is correct? Techniques: (1) Check result count matches expectations (filtered result should be smaller), (2) Spot-check specific values (does the first sorted item have the smallest value?), (3) Verify aggregates manually on small test data (calculate sum by hand, compare to code result), (4) Check that no data was accidentally lost or duplicated. Students practice verifying transformations and articulate what "correct" means for each operation type.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G6.02: Filter table rows based on a condition
  * T10.G6.05: Group data and compute aggregates per group
  * T10.G5.24: Verify table operations produce expected results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G6.22
Skill: Implement a simple lookup cache with lists

Description:
Students implement a basic caching pattern: store recently looked-up values to avoid redundant searching. Using two parallel lists (keys and values), they check if a key is already cached before doing an expensive lookup. If found in cache, return immediately; if not, perform the lookup, store the result in the cache, then return it. This introduces the concept of time-space trade-offs: using memory (cache) to save time (avoid repeated searches). Students measure the performance difference with and without caching on repeated lookups.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G6.04: Use table lookup to find related data
  * T10.G4.02: Store and retrieve parallel list data
  * T10.G4.01.01: Find an item's position using built-in block

Skill: Pivot or reshape table data

Description:
Students use CreatiCode's `pivot [source] into [result] row groups [cols] columns [values] methods [methods]` block to reshape data from "long" format (many rows, few columns) to "wide" format (fewer rows, more columns) or vice versa, preparing data for different types of analysis.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G6.05: Group data and compute aggregates per group

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G7.02
Skill: Import external data into a table

Description:
Students use the `import file into table [table]` block to load data from an external CSV file into a table. They understand file formats, handle the imported structure, and verify the data loaded correctly.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.02: Create a table and add columns
  * T10.G5.04: Read a cell value from a table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G7.03
Skill: Design a table schema for a real-world scenario

Description:
Students design the structure of a table (what columns to include, what data types they hold) to model a real-world domain. They create a table with appropriate column names, justify their design choices (why these columns? what data type?), and demonstrate by populating the table with sample data that validates their design. Example domains: Library catalog (columns: title, author, ISBN, genre, available_copies); Game inventory (item_name, item_type, quantity, value, rarity); Sports statistics (player_name, team, position, points, assists).

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.02: Create a table and add columns

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T10.G7.04
Skill: Visualize table data with charts

Description:
Students use CreatiCode's chart blocks like `draw [line/bar/pie] chart using columns [...] from table [table]` to create visual representations of their data. They also use `draw [type] chart using category column [col1] value column [col2] from table [table]` for categorical data visualization (e.g., bar chart of sales by region, pie chart of votes by candidate). They choose appropriate chart types: line charts for trends over time, bar charts for comparing categories, and pie charts for showing proportions of a whole.

Dependencies:
  * T10.G5.08: Use built-in table aggregate blocks
  * T10.G6.05: Group data and compute aggregates per group

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skill: Implement a hash table lookup using lists

Description:
Students simulate a simple hash table by using a list where each position corresponds to a hash value computed using modulo operation (e.g., hash(key) = key mod list_length for numbers, or sum of character codes mod list_length for strings). They handle collisions using linear probing (check next positions) or chaining (store multiple items at one position using lists within lists). Implementation pattern: Use a list as the hash table, create a hash function using math operators and string blocks, use linear search as fallback for collisions, and compare performance to linear search to demonstrate the principle of constant-time lookup.

Description:
Students implement binary search algorithm to find items in O(log n) time instead of O(n) linear search. They repeatedly divide the sorted list's search space in half: compare the middle element to the target, then search either the left half (if target is smaller) or right half (if target is larger). Students trace through the algorithm step-by-step, counting comparisons, and compare performance to linear search to demonstrate logarithmic efficiency gains.

Common applications: finding maximum sum of k consecutive elements, longest substring without repeating characters, or moving averages. Implementation pattern: Initialize window with first k elements, slide window right by adding next element and removing leftmost element, track window state (sum, max, set of unique items), update result after each slide.

Skill: Implement merge sort algorithm with recursion concept

Description:
Students implement merge sort by breaking a list into halves, sorting each half, then merging the sorted halves. While full recursion may be beyond block-based programming, students simulate the divide-and-conquer approach: manually split the list, sort the sublists (using built-in sort or bubble sort), then use the merge algorithm from G6. Students trace through the algorithm on paper showing how a list of 8 items is split into 4 pairs, sorted, merged into 2 sorted halves, then merged into the final sorted list. They compare merge sort's O(n log n) efficiency to bubble sort's O(n²) and understand why divide-and-conquer is powerful.
