============================================================
3. DEPENDENCIES REMOVED (BY TOPIC WITH JUSTIFICATION)
============================================================

Total Removed: 3 dependencies (all invalid)

T14 Games: 1 dependency removed
  Skill: T14.G3.06 - Switch to game mode
  Removed: T10.G3.01 (non-existent skill ID)
  Justification: This skill ID does not exist in the skill map
  Replacement: Added T09.G3.01.01 (correct variable skill)

T18 Simulation: 1 dependency removed
  Skill: T18.G3.03 - Initialize a 3D scene with environment
  Removed: T09.G3.01 (non-existent skill ID)
  Justification: This skill ID does not exist in the skill map
  Replacement: None needed - skill doesn't require conditionals

T25 AI Concepts: 1 dependency removed
  Skill: T25.G3.06.02 - Access table items by row and column
  Removed: T10.G3.01 (non-existent skill ID)
  Justification: This skill ID does not exist in the skill map
  Replacement: None needed - skill has other variable dependencies

NOTE: T10.G3.01 and T09.G3.01 do not exist. The correct IDs are:
  - T09.G3.01.01 (Conditionals - create variable)
  - T10.G3.01.01 (Variables - create numeric variable)

============================================================
4. INVALID DEPENDENCIES FIXED
============================================================

Total Fixed: 3 invalid dependencies

Pattern: All three invalid dependencies referenced non-existent skill IDs
Root Cause: Skills T10.G3.01 and T09.G3.01 do not exist in the curriculum
Resolution: Removed invalid references and added correct replacements where needed

Details:
1. T14.G3.06 referenced T10.G3.01 - Removed and replaced with T09.G3.01.01
2. T18.G3.03 referenced T09.G3.01 - Removed (no replacement needed)
3. T25.G3.06.02 referenced T10.G3.01 - Removed (no replacement needed)

Validation Results:
- Zero invalid dependencies remain
- All dependencies now reference existing skills
- All dependencies follow X-2 grade progression rule
- No circular dependencies detected

============================================================
5. KEY PATTERNS OBSERVED IN DEPENDENCY STRUCTURE
============================================================

PATTERN 1: Application Topics Depend on Programming Core
- Games (T14), Stories (T15), Art (T16), Simulations (T18) all require:
  * Conditionals (T09) for interactive behavior and decision making
  * Variables (T10) for tracking scores, states, and data
  * Loops (T08) for repetitive actions and animations
  * Events (T07) for user interaction and messaging

PATTERN 2: Data Topics Require Loops
- Data Visualization (T20) skills universally need loops
- Loops are essential for iterating through datasets
- This was a critical gap that has been filled

PATTERN 3: AI/ML Topics Require Data Management
- All AI/ML topics (T25-T30) depend heavily on:
  * Variables (T10) for storing and tracking data
  * Conditionals (T09) for decision-making logic
- This aligns with the nature of AI/ML algorithms

PATTERN 4: Foundational Topics Are Self-Contained
- Topics T01-T05 (Everyday Algorithms, Decompose, Pattern Recognition, Debug, Collaborate)
- Have minimal cross-topic dependencies (as designed)
- Focus on building foundational thinking skills
- Serve as prerequisites for higher-level topics

PATTERN 5: Clear Learning Progression
- Programming Core topics (T06-T13) serve as prerequisites
- Application topics (T14-T24) build on core concepts
- AI/ML topics (T25-T30) require both core and application skills
- Advanced topics (T31-T36) require mastery of earlier concepts

PATTERN 6: Most Common Cross-Topic Dependencies
- T08.G3.01 (Loops): Referenced 136 times - most fundamental
- T07.G3.01 (Events): Referenced 81 times - critical for interactivity
- T09.G3.01.01 (Conditionals/Variables): Referenced 35 times - decision making
- T10.G3.01.01 (Variables): Referenced 33 times - state management

PATTERN 7: Conservative Dependency Model
- Only added dependencies with strong keyword evidence
- Keywords checked: repeat, loop, forever, if, when, condition, variable, score, event, message
- Avoided over-specification - only truly necessary dependencies added
- Better to ensure solid prerequisites than create false dependencies

PATTERN 8: Grade Progression Compliance
- All G3 skills only depend on GK, G1, G2, and G3 skills
- X-2 rule strictly enforced throughout
- No violations detected in entire skill map

PATTERN 9: No Circular Dependencies
- Dependency graph is properly acyclic
- Clear hierarchical structure maintained
- Skills can be learned in well-defined order

PATTERN 10: Topic Clustering
- Related topics naturally cluster through shared dependencies
- Game, Story, and Art topics share many dependencies
- AI/ML topics form their own dependency cluster
- This validates the curriculum topic organization

============================================================
CONCLUSION
============================================================

Phase 2 Grade 3 dependency analysis successfully:

1. Identified and fixed all 3 invalid dependency references
2. Added 87 critical cross-topic dependencies
3. Ensured all Application, AI/ML, and Advanced topics have proper prerequisites
4. Maintained curriculum integrity - no skills deleted
5. Validated all dependencies follow grade progression rules
6. Confirmed no circular dependencies exist
7. Preserved conservative approach - only necessary changes made

The Grade 3 skill map now has:
- Valid, existing skill references for all dependencies
- Proper cross-topic dependency structure
- Clear learning paths for students
- Solid prerequisites for complex topics
- Maintained curriculum design philosophy
