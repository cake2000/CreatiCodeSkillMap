================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

ARCHITECTURE: The five topics form a coherent data science pipeline
  Represent Data (T25)
       ↓
  Collect Data (T26)
       ↓
  Analyze Data (T27) ← → Conduct Experiments (T28)
       ↓
  Process Text (T29)

This mirrors real data science workflows and promotes transfer to authentic
applications.
