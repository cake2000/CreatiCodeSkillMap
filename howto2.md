there is no AGENTS.md. Just read spec_v2_updated.md to understand the whole project, and read the key referneces like csta standard draft, and ai priorities, and creaticode introduction.

ignore ACSL since it is too theoretic!

latest skills and topic definitions are in "skillsv4" folder (ignore the other skills folders)

we are aiming for "IXL for coding based on creaticode", and we need top quality result.

read this file docs/TOPIC_IXL_MICROSTEP_GUIDE.md to learn how to do it. note that k-2 level skills will not touch code blocks yet. They start to do any coding or do scripts/blocks in grade 3. 

now, we need to enhance the quality of the skills for this version. read the file skillsv4/improvements.md, which contains all the to do tasks. 

make these changes in the files in skillsv4.
