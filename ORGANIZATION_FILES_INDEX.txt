KEY DECISION POINTS:
====================

Before executing, confirm:

1. Do you understand why files are being organized?
   → Read ORGANIZATION_PLAN_SUMMARY.md

2. Are you comfortable with the file categorization?
   → Review FILES_TO_MOVE.txt, FILES_TO_ARCHIVE.txt, FILES_TO_KEEP.txt

3. Do you want to create a backup first?
   → Recommended: cp -r . ../CreatiCodeSkillMap_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)

4. Is now a good time to reorganize?
   → Ensure no active development changes
   → Run: git status (should be clean or acceptable to commit)

5. Do you have git access to commit changes?
   → Run: git config --list (verify git is configured)

EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER ORGANIZATION:
====================================

Directory Structure:
  CreatiCodeSkillMap/
  ├── skills/ (26 files)
  ├── archive/analysis/ (172 files)
  ├── docs/ (placeholder for future)
  └── Root (~106 files)

Benefits Realized:
  ✓ Clear separation of production data and analysis
  ✓ Easier navigation and file discovery
  ✓ Professional project structure
  ✓ Ready for scaling and growth
  ✓ Historical work archived for reference

File Access After Organization:
  Main Skill File: skills/skills_k8_ai_complete_FINAL.json
  Documentation: README.md, spec.md (in root)
  Utility Scripts: *.py, *.js files (in root)
  Topic Skills: skills_T*.md files (in root)
  Analysis Files: archive/analysis/ (if needed for reference)

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:
====================

Q: Will the main production file be accessible?
A: Yes, it will be at skills/skills_k8_ai_complete_FINAL.json
   Applications can still read it easily.

Q: Can I still access analysis files?
A: Yes, all 172 analysis files are in archive/analysis/ for reference.
   They're organized for quick access when needed.

Q: What if a script breaks because of moved files?
A: Review ORGANIZATION_PLAN_SUMMARY.md FAQ section for details.
   Most scripts should work fine; hardcoded paths may need updates.

Q: Can I undo this if something goes wrong?
A: Yes, you can restore from backup or manually move files back.
   See ORGANIZATION_CHECKLIST.md troubleshooting section.

Q: Should I delete the archive files?
A: Not immediately. Keep them for one development cycle minimum.
   They document the development process and can be safely deleted later.
