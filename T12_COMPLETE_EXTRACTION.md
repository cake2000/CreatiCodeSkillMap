## Grade 1 Skills (4 skills)

### T12.G1.01
**Skill:** Find the main set of instructions
**Description:** Students look at 2–3 short sets of picture‑based instructions (e.g., "how to set up the game," "how to decorate," "how to clean up") and decide which one tells everyone what to do overall for an activity. This builds the idea that some instructions are the main plan and others are side tasks.
**Dependencies:**
* T01.GK.03: Find the first and last pictures
**Grade Level:** 1

---

### T12.G1.02
**Skill:** Give a clear title to a set of steps
**Description:** Students practice giving each group of picture steps a clear title that tells what it is for (e.g., "Getting Ready," "Playing the Game," "Clean‑Up Time") instead of vague titles like "Stuff" or "Things to Do."
**Dependencies:**
* T12.G1.01: Find the main set of instructions
**Grade Level:** 1

---

### T12.G1.03
**Skill:** Tell what each group of steps does
**Description:** Students see 2–3 groups of picture instructions for a class routine and match each group to a simple description (e.g., "These steps get the classroom ready," "These steps are for playing," "These steps are for cleaning up"). This strengthens the habit of explaining the role of each part of a plan.
**Dependencies:**
* T03.GK.01: Identify parts that make up a whole
**Grade Level:** 1

---

### T12.G1.04
**Skill:** Split a long list of steps into two lists
**Description:** Students are given a long mixed list of picture steps for a class event and asked to split them into two shorter lists (e.g., "Before the event" and "During the event," or "Adult jobs" and "Student jobs"). This mirrors splitting one big routine into smaller, organized parts.
**Dependencies:**
* T12.G1.01: Find the main set of instructions
**Grade Level:** 1

---

## Grade 2 Skills (4 skills)

### T12.G2.01
**Skill:** Add a note to explain a section of a plan
**Description:** Students add a short note near a group of steps to explain why that section is there (e.g., "These steps are to get ready," "These steps are to clean up"). This is an unplugged analogue of commenting and documenting parts of a project.
**Dependencies:**
* T01.G1.01: Put pictures in order to plant a seed
**Grade Level:** 2

---

### T12.G2.02
**Skill:** Fix confusing labels on a plan
**Description:** Students see a simple plan with section titles that are vague or unclear (e.g., "Stuff," "More things") and replace them with clearer titles that match the steps underneath (e.g., "Set up chairs," "Decorate the room"). This mirrors renaming confusing identifiers but stays at the level of everyday language.
**Dependencies:**
* T12.G1.02: Give a clear title to a set of steps
**Grade Level:** 2

---

### T12.G2.03
**Skill:** Use the same style for section titles
**Description:** Students review several section titles for one plan (e.g., "Set up," "Playing the game," "Clean up time!") and adjust or choose options so they all follow a similar style (for example, all starting with action words). This builds awareness of consistent naming without introducing code vocabulary.
**Dependencies:**
* T01.G1.01: Put pictures in order to plant a seed
**Grade Level:** 2

---

### T12.G2.04
**Skill:** Group related steps under a heading
**Description:** Students see 2–3 headings (e.g., "Before class," "During class," "After class") and a mixed set of picture steps, then group each step under the heading where it belongs. This extends the Grade 1 idea of splitting lists into clearly labeled sections.
**Dependencies:**
* T03.G1.02: Group related parts into categories
* T03.G1.03: List steps for a simple classroom routine
**Grade Level:** 2

---

## Grade 3 Skills (5 skills)

### T12.G3.01
**Skill:** Add a comment to explain a block in a script
**Description:** Students use the comment block (// [text]) from the My Blocks category to add simple comments that label or explain parts of their script (e.g., "// Move the cat" or "// Check if score > 10"). This introduces the concept of documenting code for others to understand.
**Dependencies:**
* T07.G3.02: Trace a script with a simple loop
* T12.G2.01: Add a note to explain a section of a plan
**Grade Level:** 3

---

### T12.G3.02
**Skill:** Create a header comment for a script
**Description:** Students add a comment block (// [text]) at the beginning of a script, right after the hat block, that summarizes the script's purpose and role in the larger program (e.g., "// Game initialization: sets lives to 3, resets score, shows start screen"). This is a first step toward systematic documentation.
**Dependencies:**
* T09.G3.02: Use a variable in a conditional (if block)
* T12.G3.01: Add a comment to explain a block in a script
**Grade Level:** 3

---

### T12.G3.03
**Skill:** Simplify nested or repeated blocks for readability
**Description:** Students take a short script with deeply nested conditionals or repeated patterns and simplify it by: (1) using clearer variable names, (2) reordering conditions to reduce nesting, (3) splitting into separate event-driven scripts, or (4) combining similar consecutive blocks. Focus is on recognizing cluttered code and improving structure without custom blocks.
**Dependencies:**
* T07.G3.03: Build a forever loop for simple animation
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
**Grade Level:** 3

---

### T12.G3.04
**Skill:** Explain the structure of a multi-script project
**Description:** Students write or select explanations for how the scripts in a project interact and fit together (e.g., "The green-flag script sets up the game, and the key-press scripts let the player control the character"). This develops understanding of overall code organization.
**Dependencies:**
* T08.G3.03: Pick the right conditional block for a scenario
* T10.G3.02: Find and count items in a list with a condition
**Grade Level:** 3

---

### T12.G3.05
**Skill:** Create and use a simple custom block
**Description:** Students learn to create custom blocks using CreatiCode's define syntax and call them using call syntax. In the My Blocks category, they create a simple custom block with a descriptive, action-based name (e.g., define (draw square)) that groups 3-5 related blocks, then call it from their main script using call draw square. This introduces the concept of reusable code modules.
**Dependencies:**
* T06.G3.01: Build a green‑flag script that runs a 3–5 block sequence
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T12.G3.03: Simplify nested or repeated blocks for readability

**Dependencies:**
* T12.G3.05: Create and use a simple custom block
* T12.G4.02: Choose descriptive names for custom blocks
**Grade Level:** 4

---

### T12.G4.04
**Skill:** Analyze and improve variable scope and naming
**Description:** Students examine a project and ensure that variables have clear, descriptive names (e.g., "playerScore" instead of "x") and understand whether each variable is for this sprite only or for all sprites. They rename unclear variables and add comments explaining scope.
**Dependencies:**

**Skill:** Add input parameters to a custom block
**Description:** Students create custom blocks that accept input parameters by including them in the definition signature (e.g., define (draw polygon (sides) (size))). Inside the custom block, they use (argument (sides)) and (argument (size)) to reference parameter values. When calling the block, they pass values using square brackets: call draw polygon [4] [100].
**Dependencies:**
* T12.G3.05: Create and use a simple custom block

## Grade 5 Skills (5 skills)

### T12.G5.01
**Skill:** Write a project description explaining what the program does
**Description:** Students write a clear project description (in the project notes or as a comment at the top of the main script) that explains: (1) what the project does, (2) how to use it (controls/interactions), and (3) what the main features are. This user-facing documentation helps others understand the project without reading the code.
**Dependencies:**
* T12.G4.01: Document a program with embedded comments
* T12.G4.04: Analyze and improve variable scope and naming
**Grade Level:** 5

---

### T12.G5.02
**Skill:** Add inline comments explaining how code works and why choices were made
**Description:** Students add comments that explain what specific blocks or sections of code do and why they chose that approach (e.g., "This loop moves the sprite 10 steps at a time until it reaches the edge - I use a loop instead of separate move blocks to make it easy to change the number of steps"). Focus is on describing behavior and simple reasoning for someone reading the code for the first time.
