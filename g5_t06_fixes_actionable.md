## Verification Notes

All 47 skills in List A involve students:
- **Building/implementing** executable code
- **Creating** programs, games, simulations, or features
- **Writing** scripts that need event triggers to run
- **Adding** functionality to projects
- **Configuring** systems that execute code

None of the 31 skills in List C require T06 because they involve:
- Tracing/analyzing existing code
- Recognizing patterns without implementation
- Planning without building
- Conceptual understanding
- Research or discussion activities
