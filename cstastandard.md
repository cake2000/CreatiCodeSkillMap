# Introduction

In a world increasingly powered by computing, students of all identities and chosen career paths need quality computer science (CS) education to become informed citizens and confident creators. Our vision for K-12 CS education is to ensure:

- All students are engaged and supported in learning CS, including its impacts on individuals, societies, cultures, democracies, and policies.  
- Policies, pedagogies, and practices support all students learning CS.  
- Standards align with the current and future needs for learning CS.

CSTA's K-12 Computer Science Standards delineate a core set of learning objectives designed to provide the foundation for a complete CS curriculum and its implementation at the K-12 level. The Standards, last published in 2017, were designed by educators to be coherent and comprehensible to teachers, administrators, and policymakers. The Standards are a primary resource for state and local education agencies when determining what K-12 students need to know and be able to do in CS. States widely adopted the Standards, which has impacted millions of students and promoted coherence in state policy, curriculum development, teacher certification, and teacher preparation and professional development across the U.S.

Increased implementation of CS in K-12 schools, continuously evolving research, and recent technological advancements necessitate an update to the CSTA K-12 Standards. As such, CSTA is conducting a three-year CSTA K-12 Standards revision process. Research began in fall 2023, writing kicked off in fall 2024, and the target date for publishing the updated standards is summer 2026.

CSTA defined the following values to guide the revision process and provide a lens for reflecting on and refining project outputs:

Flexible in implementation: Considers multiple pathways for meeting individual needs of learners, including regional, cultural, ability, social, and economic factors.

Ultimately, the goal of the CSTA K-12 Standards revision process is to improve the quality of K-12 CS teaching and learning by:

- Clarifying student learning outcomes across K-12 that:  
> Are driven by research and informed by teacher practice  
» Represent meaningful progressions  
» Define what is foundational for all students

- Maintaining coherence of instruction across the U.S. and beyond  
- Ensuring that the updated standards work for teachers and students, regardless of the particular context or curriculum  
Providing flexibility and guidance for state and local adaptation

# Additional Context for Reviewers

This document represents the second of three major drafts before CSTA publishes the updated standards in the summer of 2026. Feedback on this draft will inform how we refine the language and content of the standards, and how we develop clarification statements and other supports. At this stage, feedback that critiques the clarity and coherence of progressions within and/or across grade bands is most helpful. Feedback on specific word choices is less helpful now and will be more of a focus in the next round of feedback.

The writing team is currently using the following assumptions as guides throughout the writing process to help determine the volume, depth, and breadth of standards:

- Students will experience a certain amount of instructional time at each grade band:  
Elementary (Grades PreK-5): 20 to 40 hours per year (or 30 to 60 minutes per week)  
» Middle school (Grades 6-8): the equivalent of one yearlong course  
» High school (Grades 9–12): the equivalent of one yearlong course  
- Implementation will vary and may include discrete courses and/or integration in other subject areas.  
- Students will experience the full vertical progression (i.e., students learn the content in the PreK-5 standards before entering middle school and learn the content in the 6-8 standards prior to entering high school).

While these assumptions may not reflect the current reality of CS instruction in all schools, they represent a reasonable target for the future. We also acknowledge that the volume of standards in this current draft may not align with all of these assumptions and likely requires more instructional time than is feasible in many school contexts. We ask reviewers to focus on identifying which standards are essential and which are comparatively less important. This feedback will be invaluable as we reduce the number of standards in subsequent drafts.

CSTA and the standards writing team look forward to reviewing your valuable insights as we work to define the future of PreK-12 CS education.

# Navigating the Standards

We organized the foundational standards for PreK through high school around three primary components: Topic Areas, Pillars, and Dispositions. Topic Areas serve to organize standards by content. The five Topic Areas are: (1) Algorithms and Design, (2) Programming, (3) Data and Analysis, (4) Systems and Security, and (5) Computing and Society. We recognized artificial intelligence (AI) as a priority during the standards revision process. AI-related content is distributed across the five Topic Areas instead of being a discrete topic area.

Pillars consist of essential ideas and practices that cut across all topic areas. The four pillars are: (1) Impacts and Ethics, (2) Inclusive Collaboration, (3) Computational Thinking, and (4) Human-Centered Design.

Dispositions are habits of mind fostered within CS classrooms and developed through instruction that includes the topic areas and pillars. The highest-priority dispositions within the CS context are: creativity, sense of belonging in CS, critical thinking, persistence, reflectiveness, resourcefulness, and curiosity.

![](images/4b5d26dd2d617a699b2c78f3fca471bcd3562f976ffbe794da57e3c1183c9ba4.jpg)

The draft PreK-12 standards within this organizational structure are foundational for all students. We adapted this structure from the Reimagining CS Pathways: High School and Beyond project, which aimed to create a community definition of what a foundational CS learning experience for all high school students includes and possible CS learning opportunities beyond that foundation. The graphic provides a visual representation of the relationship between topic areas, pillars, and dispositions.

The Reimagining CS Pathways project identified seven high school specialty areas for continued learning: (1) Software Development, (2) Cybersecurity, (3) Artificial Intelligence, (4) Physical Computing, (5) Data Science, (6) Game and Interactive Media Design, and (7) X + CS. We organized specialty areas in two levels: Specialty I and Specialty II. Specialty standards appear after the PreK-12 foundational standards. The draft specialty standards are intended for students who have completed foundational CS learning experiences and want to continue their study of CS in one or more of these areas. This likely includes students who wish to pursue computing-intensive postsecondary education or who have a particular interest in one or more specialty areas. Implementing the specialty standards may vary based on state/local contexts, resources, partnerships, and other priorities. Specialty I standards are foundational to the specialty area and Specialty II standards describe advanced study within the specialty area.

Lastly, throughout the standards, students attend to the societal and environmental impacts of computing. We use the term societal to encompass social, governmental, political, cultural, and economic factors.

# Topic Areas

![](images/52241bf132f7df66d38e9613c2e4f927ee239b7be98a97879b89395a386e154e.jpg)

# Algorithms and Design

Overview: An algorithm is a sequence of steps designed to accomplish a specific task. Algorithms are translated into programs, or code, to provide instructions for computing devices. In early grades, students learn about age-appropriate algorithms from the real world. As they progress, students learn about the development, combination, and decomposition of algorithms; the evaluation of competing algorithms; and the difference between traditional algorithms and artificial intelligence/ machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms.

The Algorithms and Design standards and the Programming standards are complementary and should be considered in tandem. Algorithms and Design standards focus more on program planning and evaluation, while Programming standards focus more on program implementation.

<table><tr><td>Subtopic</td><td>Overview</td></tr><tr><td>Algorithm Fundamentals</td><td>Designing algorithms, or step-by-step solutions to a task, are an essential component of CS. In early grades, students identify and create algorithms reflecting tasks in their daily lives. As students progress, they develop more complex algorithms, create visual representations of their solutions, and compare traditional algorithms to AI/ML algorithms.</td></tr><tr><td>Human-Centered Design</td><td>Many algorithms are designed to help people, so understanding user needs is essential to good algorithm design. In early grades, students identify how algorithms can support others and they use a human-centered approach to inform their choices when designing simple instructions. As students progress, they apply human-centered design principles to develop and refine computational algorithms, using feedback from others to improve performance and usability. In later grades, students evaluate algorithms for fairness, accessibility, and inclusivity, considering the broader impact of their designs on diverse user groups.</td></tr><tr><td>Problem Solving</td><td>While there may be many approaches to addressing a task, optimizing an algorithm can result in more efficient and accurate solutions. In early grades, students focus on patterns and decomposition to improve their algorithms. As students progress, they begin to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of computational algorithms running under different conditions and use problem-solving skills to explore algorithms underlying opaque systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Impacts of Algorithms</td><td>Algorithms can have positive and negative effects on people and society. It is important to evaluate not only how well an algorithm works, but also who it benefits, who it may unintentionally harm, and why. In early grades, students begin by exploring how algorithms can lead to different results for themselves and others. As students progress, they learn to identify possible consequences of algorithmic decisions. In later grades, students critically analyze the societal impacts of algorithms, including issues of fairness, equity, accessibility, and bias, and consider how algorithmic systems can shape real-world experiences.</td></tr></table>

# Programming

Overview: Programming controls all computing systems, empowering people to communicate with the world in new ways and solve compelling problems. The development process to create meaningful and efficient programs involves choosing which information to use and how to process and store it, breaking apart large problems into smaller ones, recombining existing solutions, and analyzing different solutions.

The Algorithms and Design standards and the Programming standards are complementary and should be considered in tandem. Algorithms and Design standards focus more on program planning and evaluation, while Programming standards focus more on program implementation.

# Notes:

- Many standards in this topic area discuss creating or reviewing "code." Not all code is text-based or screen-based. In particular, students in early grades may interface with tangible programming systems. Standards were written considering the programming tools commonly used at each grade level.  
- While the other four topic areas contain a subtopic addressing societal and ethical impacts, the Programming topic area weaves societal and ethical impacts throughout its five subtopics.

<table><tr><td>Subtopic</td><td>Overview</td></tr><tr><td>Programming Fundamentals</td><td>Across grade levels, students focus on reading and interpreting code, translating algorithms into code, and understanding programming languages&#x27; types, syntax, and semantics. Although programming constructs repeat across this subtopic, their complexity is expected to increase as students advance through grade levels.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Handling</td><td>Understanding how programs structure and store data is necessary for successful programming. In early grades, students focus on identifying and labeling data in their daily lives and in age-appropriate programming languages. As students progress, they learn about and manipulate more complex data types.
Note: This subtopic focuses on data used while programming. The Data and Analysis topic area focuses more on collecting, storing, and analyzing data with the use of computing.</td></tr><tr><td>Program Development</td><td>Programming involves paying attention to the organization and structure of code. In early grades, students strengthen their understanding of how to create programs. As students progress, they focus more on building on existing code, modularizing code, documenting code, and using AI tools to support their programming.</td></tr><tr><td>Testing and Refining Code</td><td>Ensuring that code works as intended is key to building reliable programs. In early grades, students focus on identifying and fixing errors in their programs. As students progress, they focus on more complex troubleshooting strategies, optimizing their code for efficiency and usability and assessing the accuracy and bias of AI-generated code.</td></tr><tr><td>Project Management</td><td>Programming projects are often collaborative. Collaboration is enhanced with defined project roles, shared documentation, and acknowledgment of project contributions. In the early grades, students focus on explaining how they completed their programming projects and how they collaborated effectively with others while coding. As they progress, students focus on program documentation, attribution, version control, and the computational and social impacts of programming decisions.</td></tr></table>

# Data and Analysis

Overview: Computers collect and store data so it can be analyzed to better understand the world and make more accurate predictions. The amount of digital data generated in the world is rapidly expanding, so the need to process data effectively is increasingly important.

<table><tr><td>Subtopic</td><td>Overview</td></tr><tr><td>Data Fundamentals</td><td>Data is generated and collected by people, often using computing technologies such as sensors and other automated systems. Metadata is “data about data.” Metadata provides context about data, including its origin, structure, and purpose. In early grades, students learn about different types of data and how data are generated, collected, and organized. As they progress, students gain experience with larger and more varied datasets, learn about more advanced data types and organization structures, and develop data documentation.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Processing</td><td>Computing devices process data to make it useful for analysis. In earlier grades, students learn how to use computational tools to manipulate data: filtering, grouping, summarizing, transforming, and reshaping data. As students progress, they apply computational methods to: automate data cleaning, identify and handle errors in data, and prepare data for analysis.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Investigation</td><td>Data investigations are a multistep process. When conducting data investigations, students pose data questions, use computational tools to collect and analyze data, create data visualizations, generate insights, and tell the story of their data. In early grades, students focus on asking simple questions that can be answered with small datasets. As students progress, they work with larger datasets, asking and answering more sophisticated questions that consider variability and relationships between multiple variables.</td></tr><tr><td>Impacts of Data Science</td><td>Students explore how data influences decision-making and impacts individuals and communities. Students examine the benefits, risks, and ethical considerations around data use. In early grades, students discuss how using data can help them make more informed decisions in their daily lives. As students progress, they explore issues related to bias in data, data privacy, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and large-scale societal and environmental impacts of data science applications.</td></tr></table>

# Systems and Security

Overview: Systems and Security includes the broad categories of hardware and software, networks, and cybersecurity. The physical components (hardware) and instructions (software) that make up a computing system communicate and process information in digital form. Networks connect computing devices to share information and resources. Greater connectivity in the computing world has also led to an increased need for security to protect the information being transmitted.

<table><tr><td>Subtopic</td><td>Overview</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware and Software</td><td>Computing systems use hardware and software to communicate and process information in digital form. In early grades, students learn how systems use both hardware and software to represent and process information. As they progress, students gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between hardware and software at multiple levels within computing systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Networks</td><td>Computing devices communicate with one another across networks to share information. In early grades, students learn that computers connect them to other people, places, and things around the world. As they progress, students gain a deeper understanding of how information is sent and received across different types of networks.</td></tr><tr><td>Security</td><td>Transmitting information securely across networks requires appropriate protection. In early grades, students learn how to protect their personal information. As they progress, students learn about information transmission across devices, network design, and how to protect networks from different types of threats.</td></tr><tr><td>Impacts of Computing Systems</td><td>Humans created computing systems to accomplish tasks and solve problems. While there have been benefits, there have also been harms and the creation of new problems. In early grades, students examine the impacts of computing systems on individuals. As they progress, students learn about the impacts of computing systems on global society.</td></tr></table>

![](images/55817735826f0770bc2e1484fb690b727fd4dcfcde282c6b035cb651b85df4d8.jpg)

# Computing and Society

Overview: Computing shapes—and is shaped by—individuals, communities, and cultures. It plays a powerful role in transforming daily life, economies, governments, and global systems. The impacts of computing are complex, producing both benefits and challenges, and raising important questions about equity, ethics, access, and responsibility. Students learn to understand, evaluate, and responsibly navigate the social implications of the digital world, including issues of equity, access, and the ethical use of technology. By examining the evolving relationship among computing, culture, and society, students become empowered to contribute thoughtfully and responsibly to a digital future.

<table><tr><td>Subtopic</td><td>Overview</td></tr><tr><td>History of Computing</td><td>Modern computing has roots in the 1800s and has evolved in response to human needs and innovations across time. In early grades, students first identify how computing is used in daily life. Then they focus on how technologies have evolved over time in response to social, scientific, and economic needs. In middle grades, students evaluate how historical challenges led to computing innovations and compare the roles played by individuals, communities, organizations, and governments in advancing these technologies. Students also explore the societal impacts of computing innovations. In later grades, students delve into the main eras of computing history and understand policy and legislation related to computing technologies. They also analyze the historic impacts of technologies, giving consideration to the factors that contributed to disparities across communities.</td></tr><tr><td>Emerging Technologies</td><td>Computing is a rapidly developing discipline. While other topic areas cover what students should know about the current field of CS, this subtopic focuses on recently developed technologies that have the potential to significantly impact society. In early grades, students learn how computing technology aids their daily life. They evaluate choices and consequences related to emerging technologies and identify problems that these advances could address. In middle grades, students evaluate how emerging technologies impact user experiences, while attending to ethical design principles. They explain how emerging technologies can inspire innovation and help people accomplish tasks in new ways. In later grades, students understand the core computational principles behind emerging technologies and compare the ethical considerations of emerging technologies, using various frameworks.</td></tr><tr><td>Career Exploration</td><td>Computing is foundational to nearly every career field. Understanding the role of computing in the workplace prepares students to make informed choices about their futures. In early grades, students recognize how digital tools and technologies support everyday work across professions. In middle grades, students explore how computational thinking drives innovation across industries and examine the ethical challenges that professionals may encounter. In later grades, students connect computing to their personal interests and career goals, investigate computing-related pathways, and analyze how advancements in technology foster new opportunities for growth across diverse fields.</td></tr></table>

# Pillars

Pillars differ from Topic Areas and include key ideas and practices that are integral to each Topic Area. All Pillars contain practices. Each standard is intended to reflect both content and one or more practices. Two Pillars, Impacts and Ethics and Human-Centered Design, also contain key ideas. These key ideas are intended to appear in relevant Topic Areas as one or more distinct subtopics.

![](images/06a85941d49f06b6fb13fd3483037fe3abe2fdc4789988d8f28d6ce8b8bf6669.jpg)

# Impacts and Ethics

The goal of the Impacts and Ethics pillar is for students to understand the societal and ethical implications of pervasive computing technologies. Students should study these implications to support themselves in becoming responsible creators of technology who use computing to benefit all members of society, including the most vulnerable. The key ideas for Impacts and Ethics are synthesized from multiple sources, including the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy (STEL; ITEEA, 2020), the National Curriculum Standards for Social Studies (NCSS, 2010), and the K-12 CS Framework (2016). The practices for Impacts and Ethics are based on the Association for Computing Machinery's list of general ethical principles (ACM, 2018).

# Key Ideas

1. Access to and use of computing technologies differ across groups of people (e.g., by socioeconomic status; geographic location; cultural background; differences in ability, gender, race and ethnicity, and other social identities).  
2. Computing has both positive and negative impacts on society and the environment.

a. Computing technologies impact people differently depending on their values, socioeconomic statuses, geographic locations, cultural backgrounds, abilities, and social identities.  
b. There are laws to regulate the design and use of computing technologies, as well as unsuccessful attempts to enact such laws.

3. Responsible creation and use of computing technology requires attention to ethical issues.

a. Decisions made about the design and use of computing technologies involve consideration of costs, benefits, and trade-offs.  
b. Computing technology should be optimized to perform the task for which it was designed with the fewest possible harmful impacts on users and the environment.

# Practices

1. Use computing for the public good.

a. Create computing technologies that are inclusive and accessible for diverse groups of people. Do not create technologies where the benefits and harms accrue to different groups of people. Harms can include physical or mental injury, destruction or disclosure of information, and damage to property, reputation, and the environment.  
b. Carefully consider the potential impacts of new computing technologies to avoid unintentionally causing harm. Avoid, mitigate, and remediate harms caused by computing technologies.

2. Respect users and other creators when creating computational technologies.

a. Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts. Only use others' work with permission and give appropriate attribution to others' work.  
b. Respect users' privacy. Clearly explain to users what information is being collected, how their information will be stored and used, and when it will be disposed of. Only collect the minimum amount of information necessary and protect data from unauthorized access and accidental disclosure.

# Inclusive Collaboration

The core of the Inclusive Collaboration Pillar is to help students develop productive collaborations with diverse groups of people. The practices in this Pillar, which were synthesized from the STEL (ITEEA, 2020), the Social Justice Standards (Learning for Justice, n.d.), the Framework for 21st Century Learning (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2009), and the K-12 CS Framework (2016), address communication and other social skills, project management skills, and personal conduct when working with others.

# Practices

1. Communicate clearly, using oral, written, and nonverbal methods, and practice intercultural competence.

a. Cultivate working relationships with individuals possessing diverse perspectives, skills, and personalities. Aim to build empathy, respect, understanding, and connection.  
b. Communication is an exchange; students should know when it is appropriate to speak and when it is appropriate to listen. Understand that different groups of people have different norms around communication. Express curiosity about the perspectives of others and exchange ideas in an open-minded way.  
c. Develop conflict resolution skills, including active listening, empathy, perspective-taking, and emotional management. These skills help students solve problems and find common ground with their peers, leading to more effective collaborations.  
d. Leverage social and cultural differences to create new ideas and increase both innovation and the quality of work.

2. Actively manage projects and project teams.

a. Manage time effectively. Break a project into smaller parts. Work backward from major deadlines and set interim deadlines for each part of the project, considering whether some parts need to be completed before other parts.  
b. Document workflows, work processes, and work products to create a shared understanding among team members and transparency for those with interests in the project work.  
c. Establish common goals and team norms. Define team roles and create equitable workloads. Leverage team members' strengths to accomplish common goals and value the individual contributions of each team member. Be flexible, helpful, and willing to make necessary compromises to accomplish a common goal.

3. Act responsibly and demonstrate accountability to others.

a. Be honest and reliable. Actively participate in collaborative work and assume shared responsibility for work products. Be on time for team meetings and meet team deadlines.  
b. Solicit and incorporate feedback from team members and other interested parties.  
c. Engage in self-reflection. Students should continually examine their own actions, decisions, and interactions with team members during a project to learn from experience and identify areas needing improvement.

# Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is a way of thinking about problems and formulating problems and solutions so that an information-processing agent (e.g., a computer) can solve them. Computational thinking practices should underpin instruction in each Topic Area and connect students' CS learning experiences. Embedded within this Pillar is the engineering design process, in which students identify and define computational problems, develop computational solutions, and iteratively test, refine, and optimize those solutions. These practices are largely based on the original Computational Thinking practices from the K-12 CS Framework (2016), but also incorporate ideas from the Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice (NGA Center & CCSSO, 2010, pp. 6-8).

# Practices

1. Define and decompose computational problems.

a. Identify complex, interdisciplinary, real-world problems that can be solved computationally.  
b. Evaluate whether it is appropriate and feasible to solve a problem computationally.  
c. Decompose complex problems into manageable subproblems that could integrate existing solutions or procedures.  
d. Analyze computational problems, identify sources of error, and plan solution pathways.  
e. Identify and fix errors in computer programs and computing systems, using a systematic process.

2. Recognize patterns; develop and use algorithms and abstractions.

a. Look for patterns and repetition. Identify and create general methods (i.e., algorithms) for performing repetitive tasks.  
b. Extract common features from a set of integrated processes or complex phenomena.  
c. Evaluate existing technological functionalities and incorporate them into new designs.  
d. Create modules and develop points of interaction that can apply to multiple situations and reduce complexity.  
e. Model phenomena and processes and simulate systems to understand and evaluate potential outcomes.

3. Create and/or modify computational artifacts, using an engineering design process. The artifacts can be for practical uses, entertainment, or personal expression.

a. Plan the development/modification of computational artifacts, using an iterative process that includes reflection on and modification of the plan, taking into account key features, time and resource constraints, and user expectations.  
b. Put the plan into action to develop the artifact. For group development projects, apply the principles of inclusive collaboration.  
c. Iteratively test, evaluate, and refine computational artifacts to enhance performance, reliability, usability, and accessibility.

# Human-Centered Design

Using human-centered design practices is a critical piece of responsibly creating computational solutions. Human-centered design includes principles of human-computer interaction. The following key ideas and practices are drawn from a variety of well-known sources on human-centered design, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, 2021), the Interaction Design Foundation (IDF, n.d.a, n.d.b), and the UX Design Institute (Vinney, 2023), as well as the K-12 CS Framework (2016).

# Key Ideas

1. Human-centered design is an approach to designing products and systems that focuses on human needs and requirements. This approach improves user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability, and human well-being. Human-centered design also helps counteract or mitigate ways that products and systems may harm humans.  
2. Humans vary in our physical characteristics and abilities, social and cultural backgrounds, and attitudes and motivations. There is no such thing as a single "average user" of computational technology, and designers of computational technologies should not assume their own experiences are universal. Instead, designers should work to understand how human variation relates to computational products and systems and purposely design to accommodate this variation.  
3. Humans are capable of complex reasoning, but we also have limitations to our attention and memory and biases toward our own experiences and beliefs. Designers of computational technologies should understand how human cognition influences the way we interact with and process information from computational technologies.  
4. Humanity-centered design focuses on designing products and systems that consider human society, human communities, and the environment. Rather than focusing on the experiences of individual users, humanity-centered design focuses on the interconnectedness of the world and complex systems of cause-and-effect relationships to address larger problems.

# Practices

1. Be human-centered. As a part of any design and development process, students should learn about the people who may use or otherwise be affected by a computational technology. When possible, students should include a diverse sample of people to inform the design and development of computational technologies, including identifying what problems need to be solved, evaluating potential solutions, and testing products in development.  
2. Start with small and simple interventions and iterate rather than rushing into big design solutions. Continually prototype, test, review, and refine solutions to make sure they meet human needs without causing harms.

There are standards for each individual elementary grade. All identifiers for elementary standards begin with an E, followed by a letter (K to indicate PreK–Kindergarten standards) or number (1–5) to indicate the grade level. Standards for grades 6–8 are banded together as middle school standards. Identifiers for middle school standards begin with "MS." Standards for grades 9–12 are banded together as high school standards. Identifiers for high school standards begin with "HS."

The next two groups of characters indicate the topic area and subtopic for each standard. The following table shows the abbreviations for each topic area and subtopic. The last two digits of each standard reflect the standard number. The foundational standards begin with 01 for each topic area in each grade or grade band. The standards are numbered continuously across subtopic areas within each grade or grade band. The numbering restarts for each topic area.
