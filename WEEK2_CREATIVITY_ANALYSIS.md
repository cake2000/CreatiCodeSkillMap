## What's Missing?

### Gap Analysis

Despite strong overall creative coverage, there are specific creative elements not explicitly taught:

#### 🎨 Missing: Explicit Aesthetic Design Skill
**What's lacking:** A skill specifically about choosing color palettes, typography, and visual themes

**Current coverage:** T16.G7.05 (Mockups) touches on this but doesn't explicitly teach color theory, typography principles, or aesthetic decision-making

**Recommendation:** Add **T20.G7.05 - Design a Visual Theme for Your Project**
- Choose color palette based on mood/emotion
- Select typography matching personality
- Create cohesive visual language
- Consider cultural and accessibility factors

---

#### ✨ Missing: User Delight & Microinteractions
**What's lacking:** Skills about adding delightful small details

**Current coverage:** None explicitly

**Recommendation:** Add **T16.G7.06 - Add Delightful Details to Your Interface**
- Design satisfying animations
- Create fun loading screens
- Add Easter eggs and surprises
- Write playful, helpful microcopy
- Make errors friendly

---

#### 💡 Missing: Creative Ideation Techniques
**What's lacking:** Explicit teaching of brainstorming/creative thinking methods

**Current coverage:** Students are expected to "have ideas" but not taught HOW to generate them

**Recommendation:** Add **T05.G6.07 - Brainstorm Creative Solutions to Problems**
- Ideation techniques (Crazy 8s, SCAMPER, mind mapping)
- Generate many ideas before judging
- Combine ideas in unexpected ways
- Embrace wild ideas, then refine

---

#### 📖 Missing (Lower Priority): Narrative Design
**What's lacking:** Storytelling within apps (not just about apps)

**Current coverage:** T15 covers stories/animation, but not narrative IN apps

**Recommendation:** Add **T15.G7.06 - Craft a Narrative Experience in Your App**
- Onboarding stories
- Character-driven tutorials
- Narrative feedback
- Emotional connection

---

#### 🎵 Missing (Lower Priority): Audio Design
**What's lacking:** Sound design and music selection

**Current coverage:** Can be addressed in existing T21 (AI Media) and T15 (Animation/Media)

**Recommendation:** Add **T21.G7.05 - Design Audio for Your Project** (or enhance existing skills)
- Choose/create sound effects
- Select music matching mood
- Balance audio levels
- Accessibility considerations

---
