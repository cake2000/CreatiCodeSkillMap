## Key Principles Applied

### 1. Concrete Over Abstract
**Before:** "Students discuss how algorithms influence what we see"
**After:** "Students build a recommendation simulator using variables and if-blocks that demonstrates tracking and personalization"

### 2. Use the Platform
Every Grade 3-8 skill now leverages unique CreatiCode features:
- AI blocks (ChatGPT, DALL-E, perception)
- Widget blocks (interactive UIs)
- Cloud/data blocks (Google Sheets, tables)
- Core blocks (variables, conditionals)

### 3. Evidence-Based Learning
**Before:** "Students write guidelines about AI bias"
**After:** "Students test AI blocks with 10+ prompts, document bias patterns, then write evidence-based guidelines"

### 4. Maintained Coherence
- K-2 remain picture-based (awareness building)
- Grade 3-5 transition to simple coding (personal/community impact)
- Grade 6-8 use advanced tools (systematic analysis, frameworks, policy)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- No skills deleted (preserves curriculum coverage)
- K-2 unchanged (proven unplugged approach)
- CSTA alignment maintained (all codes preserved)
- Cross-topic dependencies preserved (only invalid ones removed)

### Medium Risk - Dependency on Other Topics
**Risk:** New dependencies on T16, T19, T21-T24 assume those topics are well-developed.

**Mitigation:**
- Validate those topics exist and are grade-appropriate BEFORE implementing T35 changes
- If topics incomplete, defer T35 implementation OR adjust dependencies
- Document which T35 skills need which T## skills (already done in plans)

### Low-Medium Risk - Increased Complexity
**Risk:** Enhanced descriptions are more complex (building projects vs. discussions).

**Mitigation:**
- Complexity is age-appropriate (scaffolded across grades)
- Challenge formats clearly specify expectations
- Projects use blocks students learned in T06-T09, T16, T19, T21-T24 (not new concepts)
- Discussion/reflection still included alongside coding (balanced approach)

### Negligible Risk - Time Requirements
**Risk:** Coding projects take longer than discussions.

**Mitigation:**
- Projects are scoped for 1-3 class periods
- Simple scaffolded builds (not complex apps)
- Students can work in pairs/groups to share time
- Deeper learning justifies extra time

"This optimization transforms ethics from abstract discussion to hands-on demonstration. Students will BUILD privacy tools, TEST AI for bias, and CREATE assessment frameworks using CreatiCode's unique AI and widget capabilities."

### For Teachers
"Enhanced skills provide clear coding activities with specific blocks to use. Instead of facilitating open-ended discussions, you'll guide students through building projects that make ethics concepts tangible and assessable."

### For Students
"You'll get to code AI chatbots, build privacy demonstrators, create recommendation simulators, and test real AI tools for bias—making ethics come alive through actual projects instead of just talking about it."

### For Platform Developers (CreatiCode)
"This optimization showcases CreatiCode's unique features (AI blocks, widgets, cloud data) in meaningful ethical contexts, demonstrating the platform's value for computing + society education beyond just game development."

## Conclusion

The T35 optimization represents a fundamental shift from discussion-based ethics to project-based ethics education. By leveraging CreatiCode's AI, widget, and data capabilities, students can now:

- **Experience** digital footprints by building PII detectors
- **Observe** algorithmic influence by creating recommendation simulators
- **Practice** consent mechanisms by coding privacy tools
- **Measure** AI bias by systematically testing generative models
- **Analyze** surveillance by building perception-based projects
- **Evaluate** impacts by creating interactive assessment tools

This hands-on approach makes ethics concrete, assessable, and memorable while maintaining rigorous CSTA alignment and logical grade-level progression.

**The optimization is complete and ready for implementation.**
