RECOMMENDED APPROACH
================================================================================

1. For each topic with issues, identify or create G2 and G3 intermediate skills
2. Update G4 dependencies to reference these intermediate skills instead
3. Ensure smooth progression: GK -> G1 -> G2 -> G3 -> G4
