--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE 6: T01.GK.08 - Clarify picture-based counting for non-readers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T01.GK.08
PRESERVE Skill: Count how many times

OLD Description:
**Student task:** Watch the character. Count how many times they do the same action. _Implementation note: Short animation + picture-based count choices. CSTA: EK-ALG-AF-01._

NEW Description:
**Student task:** Watch the character perform a repeated action (e.g., jump, clap, spin). Count how many times by selecting from picture-based answer choices that show the actions performed 1, 2, 3, or 4 times (using pictures of action sequences, not numerals, to support non-readers). _Implementation note: Short animation (2-4 seconds) + picture-based count choices with visual representations of quantities. CSTA: EK-ALG-AF-01._

PRESERVE Dependencies:
* T01.GK.07: Find the pattern that repeats

RATIONALE: Kindergarteners may not read numerals; clarify that choices use pictures.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE 7: T01.G1.03 - Add concrete examples for clarity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T01.G1.03
PRESERVE Skill: Add a missing last step to a routine

OLD Description:
Students see a 3-step routine and choose the correct 4th step. _Implementation note: MCQ picture choice. CSTA: E1-ALG-AF-01._

NEW Description:
Students see a 3-step routine about a familiar everyday task (e.g., making a sandwich: get bread, add peanut butter, add jelly) and choose the correct 4th step from picture options (eat, clean up, put away ingredients). _Implementation note: MCQ picture choice with 3-4 plausible options; contexts include meal prep, getting ready, classroom routines. CSTA: E1-ALG-AF-01._

PRESERVE Dependencies:
* T01.GK.06: What comes next?

Students see 3 ordered panels and choose what happens next. _Implementation note: MCQ visuals. CSTA: E1-ALG-AF-01, E1-ALG-PS-03._

NEW Description:
Students see 3 story panels showing a narrative sequence (e.g., character sees ball, walks toward ball, reaches for ball) and choose what happens next from picture options, focusing on cause-and-effect in stories rather than procedural routines. _Implementation note: MCQ visuals with story context (not everyday tasks). CSTA: E1-ALG-AF-01, E1-ALG-PS-03._

PRESERVE Dependencies:
* T01.GK.06: What comes next?

RATIONALE: Differentiate from G1.03 (routines) - this focuses on narrative causality.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE 9: T01.G3.03 - Specify concrete project contexts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T01.G3.03
PRESERVE Skill: Identify repeated blocks in a script (no loops)

OLD Description:
Students highlight which part of a script repeats the same action several times in a *specific project script*, applying the loop-pattern recognition they developed in T04.G1-G3 to a real algorithm context. _Implementation note: Highlight or click region in code. CSTA: E3-ALG-AF-01._

NEW Description:
Students highlight which blocks repeat in a short script from a familiar, simple project (e.g., sprite drawing a square, character performing a dance, robot moving in a pattern). The project should have a clear, visual goal that students can understand before examining the code. _Implementation note: Highlight or click region in code; project examples include geometric drawing, simple animation, basic movement patterns. CSTA: E3-ALG-AF-01._

PRESERVE Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T04.G2.01: Identify the repeating unit in a longer pattern

RATIONALE: "Specific project script" is vague; concrete examples clarify expectations.


================================================================================
HIGH PRIORITY CHANGES (Should implement in Phase 1)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE 10: T01.G1.09 - Clarify multiple-goal matching challenge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T01.G1.09
PRESERVE Skill: Match an algorithm to its goal

OLD Description:
Students match short routines to labels like "clean desk," "feed pet," "get ready for recess." _Implementation note: Matching lines between sequences and goals. CSTA: E1-ALG-AF-01._

NEW Description:
Students match 3-4 short picture-based routines (4-5 steps each) to goal labels, choosing from a list of 5-6 options that include some similar or overlapping goals, requiring careful attention to the specific steps in each routine. _Implementation note: Matching lines between sequences and goals; auto-graded. CSTA: E1-ALG-AF-01._

PRESERVE Dependencies: (none)

RATIONALE: Specify that task includes distractors to make matching non-trivial.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE 11: T01.G4.12 - Provide explicit comparison criteria
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T01.G4.12
PRESERVE Skill: Explain why one algorithm solution is better than another

Students compare two working algorithms and explain which they prefer (fewer steps, easier to read) and why. _Implementation note: MCQ + short explanation. CSTA: E4-ALG-IM-04._

NEW Description:
Students compare two working algorithms that achieve the same goal and explain which is better based on provided criteria: (a) fewer steps/shorter, (b) easier to understand/clearer, or (c) uses better structures like loops. _Implementation note: MCQ for selecting best algorithm + choosing explanation from provided reasons addressing clarity, efficiency, or structure. CSTA: E4-ALG-IM-04._

PRESERVE Dependencies: (none)

RATIONALE: Explicit criteria reduce ambiguity and focus student thinking.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE 12: T01.G6.01 - Align title with qualitative description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T01.G6.01

OLD Skill: Count comparisons in linear and binary search

NEW Skill: Compare efficiency of linear and binary search

PRESERVE Description:
Students qualitatively compare linear and binary search on small lists, identifying that binary search typically uses fewer comparisons by eliminating half the remaining options with each step. (Focus on *why* binary is faster, not exact counts.) _Implementation note: Table; auto-graded. CSTA: MS-ALG-AF-02._

PRESERVE Dependencies:
* T04.G2.01: Identify the repeating unit in a longer pattern

RATIONALE: Title said "count" but description emphasizes qualitative comparison.


================================================================================
NEW SKILLS TO ADD
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW SKILL 1: T01.G2.15 - Bridge picture-based to block-based coding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD THIS NEW SKILL AFTER T01.G2.14:

ID: T01.G2.15
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Match picture instructions to visual block commands
Description: Students match simple picture-based instruction sequences (e.g., arrow cards showing "forward, forward, turn right") to equivalent visual block-based commands (e.g., blocks showing "move forward," "move forward," "turn right"), recognizing that pictures and blocks can represent the same algorithm with the same outcome. _Implementation note: Drag-and-drop matching with 3-4 sequence pairs; auto-graded. Focus on 1-to-1 correspondence between picture symbols and block icons. CSTA: E2-ALG-AF-01._

Dependencies:
* T01.G2.13: Write directions to navigate a simple grid

RATIONALE: Creates explicit bridge between K-2 picture-based and G3+ block-coding approaches.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW SKILL 2a: T01.G5.02.01 - Convert flowchart to code (replaces G5.02 part 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPLACE T01.G5.02 WITH TWO SKILLS:

ID: T01.G5.02.01
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Convert a simple flowchart into code
Description: Students implement a simple flowchart (5-7 steps with 1-2 decision diamonds and 0-1 loop structures) as block-based code for a small CreatiCode project. Focus on mapping flowchart symbols (rectangles → action blocks, diamonds → if/then, loop connectors → repeat) to code constructs. _Implementation note: Coding task; auto-graded on behavior matching flowchart logic and basic structural correspondence between shapes and blocks. Project examples: simple game turn, animated sequence with choices. CSTA: E5-ALG-AF-01, E5-PRO-PF-01._

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* [ACTION REQUIRED: Add T02.G4.x or T02.G5.x for flowchart symbols, once verified]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW SKILL 2b: T01.G5.02.02 - Convert pseudocode to code (replaces G5.02 part 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ID: T01.G5.02.02
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Convert simple pseudocode into code
Description: Students implement simple pseudocode (structured text with REPEAT, IF/THEN, SET variable) as block-based code for a small CreatiCode project. Pseudocode uses conventions introduced in T02 (structured English with keywords in caps). Focus on translating text descriptions of actions into equivalent block commands. _Implementation note: Coding task; auto-graded on behavior and correspondence to pseudocode intent. Project examples: score tracker, animated routine with conditions. CSTA: E5-ALG-AF-01, E5-PRO-PF-01._

Dependencies:
* T06.G3.01: Build a green-flag script that runs a 3-5 block sequence
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01: Create and use a numeric variable for score or count
* [ACTION REQUIRED: Add T02.G4.x or T02.G5.x for pseudocode conventions, once verified]

RATIONALE FOR SPLIT: Flowchart-to-code and pseudocode-to-code are distinct translation skills. Flowcharts emphasize visual-spatial reasoning and symbol mapping; pseudocode emphasizes reading structured text and keyword recognition. Splitting allows targeted practice and clearer assessment of each skill.

NOTE: After adding G5.02.01 and G5.02.02, RENUMBER the following skills:
- OLD T01.G5.03 becomes T01.G5.04 (Convert short program into pseudocode)
- OLD T01.G5.04 becomes T01.G5.05 (Trace search algorithm)
- ... continue through G5.10 → G5.11

ALTERNATIVE (to avoid renumbering): Use sub-IDs (G5.02.01, G5.02.02) and keep G5.03-G5.10 unchanged. This is RECOMMENDED to minimize cascading changes.


================================================================================
OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT (Future consideration)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL NEW SKILL: T01.G7.09 - Introduce recursive thinking concept
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD THIS NEW SKILL AFTER T01.G7.08 (if G7 expansion desired):

ID: T01.G7.09
Topic: T01 – Everyday Algorithms
Skill: Recognize the recursive pattern in algorithm descriptions
Description: Students read natural-language descriptions of algorithms (e.g., "To count blocks in a stack: if stack is empty, answer 0; otherwise, count 1 for the top block plus the count of the remaining stack") and identify the "big idea" of recursion: solving a problem by solving a smaller version of the same problem. _Implementation note: MCQ matching descriptions to concepts ("breaks problem into smaller same-type problems," "uses a base case to stop," "calls itself with simpler input"); no code implementation. CSTA: MS-ALG-PS-07._

Dependencies:
* T07.G6.01: [Insert appropriate G6 loop skill - understanding iteration helps contrast with recursion]

RATIONALE: G8.04-05 introduce recursion conceptually but with little G7 scaffolding. This G7 skill builds intuition for "solving via smaller versions" before G8 requires tracing, making transition smoother.


================================================================================
ACTION ITEMS FOR CROSS-TOPIC VERIFICATION
================================================================================

These actions require checking other topics before finalizing T01:

ACTION 1: Verify T02 (Planning & Problem Solving) introduces flowcharts and pseudocode
- CHECK: Does T02.G4.x or earlier introduce flowchart symbols?
- CHECK: Does T02.G4.x or T02.G5.x introduce pseudocode conventions?
- IF YES: Add T02 dependencies to T01.G5.01, T01.G5.02.01, T01.G5.02.02, T01.G6.07

ACTION 2: Verify T06 (Events & Project Structure) has appropriate G6-G7 skills
- NEEDED FOR: T01.G7.01 update
- CHECK: What is the appropriate G6 or G7 skill to replace T06.G5.01?
- RECOMMENDATION: Look for multi-sprite coordination or general project building

ACTION 3: Verify T09 (Variables & Data) has appropriate G6-G7 skills
- NEEDED FOR: T01.G7.01 update
- CHECK: What is the appropriate G6 or G7 skill to replace T09.G5.01?
- RECOMMENDATION: Look for cross-sprite variables or general variable operations

ACTION 4: Verify T06 has appropriate G7-G8 custom block skills
- NEEDED FOR: T01.G8.10 update
- CHECK: Is there a G7 or G8 skill for custom blocks (with or without inputs)?
- IF NOT: Consider whether custom blocks are essential for logging skill

ACTION 5: Review T14.G3.01 dependency necessity
- CURRENT: T01.G3.12 depends on T14.G3.01 (Move sprite with arrow keys)
- QUESTION: Is keyboard movement essential for "predict final state" skill?
- ALTERNATIVE: Could T06.G3.01 + T07.G3.01 suffice for general scripting?
- RECOMMENDATION: Consider whether T14 dependency is too narrow/specific


================================================================================
