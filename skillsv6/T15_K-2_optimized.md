# T15 - User Interfaces (MAJOR REVISION - December 2025)
# PHASE 10 TRANSFORMATION: Comprehensive UI/UX with Real-World Analysis & AI Integration
#
# CORE PHILOSOPHY: UI is PROBLEM-SOLVING through COMMUNICATION
# - Every interface solves a specific human problem
# - Design thinking: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test
# - Computational thinking applies to UI: decomposition, patterns, abstraction
# - Real-world app analysis connects classroom learning to daily technology use
#
# K-2 OPTIMIZATION NOTES (December 2025):
# - Fixed sub-skill IDs: Changed K.01.01, K.01.02, etc. to flat sequential K.11, K.12, K.13, K.14
# - Active verbs throughout: Identify, Explain, Predict, Trace, Sort, Match (removed "Understand")
# - All activities 2-5 minutes, auto-gradable (tap-to-select, drag-and-drop)
# - Progressive complexity: K (picture-based) → G1 (picture/unplugged) → G2 (unplugged + digital bridge)
#
# SKILL DISTRIBUTION (K-2):
# Kindergarten: 14 skills (picture-based, no coding)
# Grade 1: 12 skills (picture-based/unplugged activities)
# Grade 2: 12 skills (unplugged/paper prototyping, bridge to digital)
