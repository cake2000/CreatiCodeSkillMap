Description: Students create algorithmic systems that transform visual input using style parameters. They implement simplified style transfer: extracting color palettes from reference images, applying edge detection filters, mapping brightness to pattern density (halftone effects), or quantizing colors to palettes.

Dependencies:
* T19.G8.26: Implement shader-like color effects algorithmically
* T19.G8.18: Create AI-human collaborative art systems

Topic: T19 – Algorithmic Art & Creative Coding
Skill: Create emergent narrative systems in generative art
Description: Students design generative art systems that tell stories through visual evolution. They implement state machines that transition between visual themes, create agent-based systems where interactions create narrative moments, or build systems that respond to accumulated history.

Dependencies:
* T19.G8.27: Create constrained generative artwork
* T19.G7.10: Implement flocking behavior for artistic patterns


ID: T19.G8.31
Topic: T19 – Algorithmic Art & Creative Coding
Skill: Plan a multi-technique generative art capstone project
Description: Students design a comprehensive generative art project integrating at least four advanced techniques (3D geometry, procedural materials, dynamic lighting, particles, noise-based motion, interactive controls, AI integration). They create a planning document specifying techniques, interactions, aesthetic goals, and success criteria.

Dependencies:
* T19.G8.09: Apply procedural textures to 3D materials
* T19.G8.10: Implement dynamic lighting systems
* T19.G8.11: Create immersive 360° or VR-ready 3D art environments
* T19.G8.27: Create constrained generative artwork


ID: T19.G8.32
Topic: T19 – Algorithmic Art & Creative Coding
Skill: Implement a multi-technique generative art capstone
Description: Students build their planned comprehensive generative art piece by coding the integration of multiple advanced techniques. They combine 3D geometry, procedural materials, dynamic lighting, particle systems, noise functions, and interactive controls into a single cohesive project.

Dependencies:
* T19.G8.31: Plan a multi-technique generative art capstone project


ID: T19.G8.33
Topic: T19 – Algorithmic Art & Creative Coding
Skill: Document and present generative artwork professionally
Description: Students create comprehensive documentation: artist statement, technical documentation describing algorithms, user guide for interactive elements, annotated code, video/GIF demonstrations, and reflection on the creative-technical process. They present their work to audiences.

Dependencies:
* T19.G8.32: Implement a multi-technique generative art capstone


ID: T19.G8.34
Topic: T19 – Algorithmic Art & Creative Coding
Skill: Build and iterate on generative art variations
Description: Students create a parameterized generative art system and produce 8+ distinct variations by systematically adjusting parameters and constraints. They document relationships between parameters and visual outcomes and identify emergent aesthetic discoveries.

Dependencies:
* T19.G8.27: Create constrained generative artwork
* T19.G7.26: Study parameter impact on aesthetic qualities


ID: T19.G8.35
Topic: T19 – Algorithmic Art & Creative Coding
Skill: Curate a digital portfolio of generative artworks
Description: Students select their best generative art pieces (8-12 works), document algorithms and techniques used, organize them into a coherent portfolio showing progression and range, and write artist statements explaining creative intent and technical approach. They create portfolio presentations suitable for sharing with educators, peers, or applications.

Dependencies:
* T19.G8.34: Build and iterate on generative art variations
* T19.G8.33: Document and present generative artwork professionally
