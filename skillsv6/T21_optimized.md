### Pattern Recognition and Response Observation

**ID:** T21.GK.04
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Observe that similar questions get similar answers
**Description:** Students watch as the teacher asks a chatbot the same or very similar questions multiple times (e.g., "What is 2+2?" asked three times) and notice the answers are similar or the same. They begin to recognize patterns in chatbot responses. Assessment: After seeing three similar questions asked, student predicts "Will the answer be the same or different?" and explains their thinking using words like "same question" or "asked before."

**Dependencies:**
* T21.GK.02: Ask a simple question to a chatbot with teacher support

---

**ID:** T21.GK.05
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Identify when a chatbot response answers the question asked
**Description:** Students evaluate simple chatbot responses to determine if they match the question. They use thumbs up/down or "yes/no" responses to indicate whether the chatbot understood and answered correctly. Assessment: Given three question-answer pairs (e.g., Q: "What color is grass?" A: "Green" vs. Q: "What color is grass?" A: "Dogs bark"), student correctly identifies which responses match their questions.

### AI Limitations Awareness (Age-Appropriate)

**ID:** T21.GK.08
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Understand that chatbots cannot see or hear them
**Description:** Students learn that chatbots interact only through typed text and cannot see their classroom, hear their voice (without speech recognition), or know what they're pointing at. They identify what information they need to type for the chatbot to understand. Assessment: Student explains why they can't just point at a picture and expect the chatbot to know what it is, and demonstrates typing/dictating a description instead.

**Dependencies:**
* T21.GK.03: Distinguish between asking a chatbot and talking to a person

---

**ID:** T21.GK.09
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Identify that chatbots can make mistakes
**Description:** Students observe examples where a chatbot gives an incorrect or silly answer. They discuss that chatbots are not perfect and sometimes make mistakes, just like people. They learn it's okay to notice when an answer seems wrong. Assessment: When shown a chatbot response that contains an obvious error (e.g., "The sun is green"), student identifies it as a mistake and suggests how they would know the correct answer (asking a teacher, looking at the real sun, etc.).

**Dependencies:**
* T21.GK.05: Identify when a chatbot response answers the question asked

---

### Sequencing and Turn-Taking

**ID:** T21.GK.10
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Understand the sequence of chatbot conversation (ask, wait, receive answer)
**Description:** Students recognize the three-step sequence of chatbot interaction: (1) ask a question, (2) wait for processing, (3) receive an answer. They practice waiting for responses and understand they cannot skip steps. Assessment: Student orders three picture cards showing the conversation sequence and explains what happens at each step using simple language like "first I ask," "then I wait," "then the chatbot answers."

**Dependencies:**
* T21.GK.02: Ask a simple question to a chatbot with teacher support

### Response Evaluation and Critical Thinking

**ID:** T21.G1.04
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Check chatbot answers using other sources
**Description:** Students learn to verify chatbot responses by comparing them to information from books, teacher explanations, or observations. They understand that checking answers is an important step, especially for facts. Assessment: Student receives a chatbot answer to a factual question, then uses one other source (book, poster, teacher, etc.) to verify if the answer is correct, and reports whether the sources agree or disagree.

**Dependencies:**
* T21.GK.09: Identify that chatbots can make mistakes

---

**ID:** T21.G1.05
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Identify when a chatbot answer is incomplete

They learn to notice what's missing and can ask additional questions to fill gaps. Assessment: Given a question and a partial chatbot response (e.g., Q: "What do frogs eat and where do they live?" A: "Frogs eat insects"), student identifies what information is missing and formulates a question to get the missing information.

**Dependencies:**
* T21.GK.05: Identify when a chatbot response answers the question asked
* T21.G1.03: Ask follow-up questions based on chatbot responses

---

**ID:** T21.G1.06
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Recognize when to ask a person instead of a chatbot
**Description:** Students identify situations where asking a person is better than asking a chatbot (e.g., questions about personal experiences, classroom rules, their teacher's feelings, immediate physical needs). They understand that chatbots are tools with specific uses, not replacements for human interaction. Assessment: Student sorts 8-10 question scenarios into two categories: "Better to ask a chatbot" and "Better to ask a person," and correctly categorizes at least 7, explaining at least two choices.

**Dependencies:**
* T21.GK.03: Distinguish between asking a chatbot and talking to a person
* T21.GK.08: Understand that chatbots cannot see or hear them

**ID:** T21.G1.07
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Use complete sentences when asking chatbot questions
**Description:** Students practice writing or dictating questions in complete sentences with proper structure (subject, verb, question word). They learn that complete sentences help chatbots understand their intent better than fragments. Assessment: Student independently types or dictates three complete sentence questions to a chatbot about a chosen topic, with each question including appropriate question words, subjects, and verbs (e.g., "How do birds build nests?" not "bird nests how").

**Dependencies:**
* T21.GK.07: Recognize that questions need to be complete to get good answers

---

**ID:** T21.G1.08
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Recognize that polite language makes questions clearer
**Description:** Students learn that using polite words (please, thank you) and clear language helps create better interactions with chatbots. While chatbots don't have feelings, polite language is good practice and helps students form clear requests. Assessment: Student revises three questions to include polite language and clear structure (e.g., changes "gimme info on dogs" to "Please tell me about dogs") and explains why the improved version is better.

**Dependencies:**
* T21.G1.07: Use complete sentences when asking chatbot questions

---

### Pattern Recognition and Prediction

**ID:** T21.G1.09
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Predict what type of answer a question will receive
**Description:** Students use their understanding of question types to predict whether they'll get a short answer (yes/no, number) or long answer (explanation, description) from a chatbot. They learn to match their question structure to the kind of information they want. Assessment: Given five different questions, student predicts whether each will get a "short answer" or "long answer" from the chatbot, correctly predicting at least 4 out of 5, and explains their reasoning for at least two predictions.

**Dependencies:**
* T21.G1.01: Ask questions using all question words (who, what, where, when, why, how)
* T21.GK.04: Observe that similar questions get similar answers

---

**ID:** T21.G1.10
**Topic:** T21 – Chatbots & Prompting
**Skill:** Notice patterns in how chatbots structure their responses
**Description:** Students observe and identify common patterns in chatbot responses (e.g., often starts with a direct answer then adds details, uses bullet points for lists, explains step-by-step for "how" questions). They use these patterns to find information more easily in responses. Assessment: After reviewing 3-4 chatbot responses to different question types, student identifies at least two patterns (e.g., "When I ask 'how,' it gives steps" or "It uses lists for multiple things") and points out where these patterns appear in the responses.

**Dependencies:**
* T21.G1.03: Ask follow-up questions based on chatbot responses
* T21.GK.04: Observe that similar questions get similar answers
