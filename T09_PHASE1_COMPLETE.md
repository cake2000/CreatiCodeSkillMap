| M4 | G7.03 possible T08 overlap | Cross-topic | **Requires T08 review** |
| M5 | G6 skill density (10 skills) | Balance | None (optional) |

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours (excluding M4 coordination)
**Impact:** Quality improvement

### LOW PRIORITY (OPTIONAL)

| ID | Issue | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | G3.01.01-04 naming | Observation | No fix needed |
| L2 | List/variable integration | Coverage | **Requires T10 review** |
| L3 | G6.06.01 assessability | Enhancement | Optional |
| L4 | G8.05 dependency count | Review | May be justified |

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Impact:** Nice-to-have

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Low Risk Items (Safe to Implement)
- H2: Simple dependency removal ✅
- M1: Simple dependency addition ✅
- M2: Description rewrite ✅
- M3: Simple dependency removal ✅

### Medium Risk Items (Check References)
- H1: Merge affects many skills ⚠️
- H3: New skill affects dependencies ⚠️

## NOTES FOR REVIEWERS

### Key Decisions Needed
1. **H1:** Merge G3.01.03 into G3.01.04, or keep separate and clarify?
2. **H3:** Insert new skill as T09.G3.06 or early G4 (like T09.G4.0X)?
3. **M4:** How does T08 handle compound conditions?
4. **M5:** Is 10 skills in G6 acceptable, or should some move to G7?

### Points of Emphasis
- T09 is already in good shape (88% of skills have no issues)
- Most fixes are low-risk dependency cleanups
- Only H1 and H3 require structural changes
- Coordination with T08/T10 can happen in parallel

### Quality Assurance
- All 59 skills reviewed individually
- All dependencies traced and verified
- K-2 compliance checked
- X-2 rule verified
- Feature coverage confirmed

## CONCLUSION

T09 (Variables & Expressions) has been **thoroughly analyzed** and is in **good condition**. The topic demonstrates excellent pedagogical progression from picture-based concepts (K-2) through sophisticated algorithmic applications (G8).

**Previous optimization work** (35→59 skills) successfully broke down complex skills and added missing features. This Phase 1 analysis identifies **12 minor issues** that, when fixed, will bring T09 to production-ready quality.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Fix HIGH priority issues immediately (1-2 hours)
2. Coordinate with T08/T10 for MEDIUM priority items
3. Implement MEDIUM and LOW priority fixes for quality
4. Validate and release

**Total estimated effort:** 4-6 hours of implementation + coordination time

**Confidence level:** 🟢 **HIGH** - Analysis is comprehensive, fixes are well-defined, risks are minimal
