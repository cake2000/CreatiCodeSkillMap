# Foundation Verification - Quick Summary

## The Bottom Line

**✅ WHAT EXISTS:**
- 447 skills in Grades 3-5
- 78 excellent computational thinking skills (Events, Loops, Conditionals, Variables, Lists, Functions)
- Strong progressive learning path
- Rich project-based applications

**❌ WHAT'S MISSING:**
- 15-20 foundational block tutorials for Motion, Looks, Sound, Sensing, Pen
- Students expected to learn blocks through project osmosis, not explicit instruction

## Coverage Status by Category

### 🟢 WELL COVERED (78 skills)
- **Events** (T06): 12 skills - Green flag, broadcasts, timing
- **Loops** (T07): 12 skills - Repeat, forever, repeat-until, nested
- **Conditionals** (T08): 12 skills - If/else, AND/OR/NOT
- **Variables** (T09): 17 skills - Create, use, types, operators
- **Lists** (T10): 13 skills - Create, iterate, search, tables
- **Functions** (T11): 12 skills - Custom blocks, parameters, returns
- **Operators**: 11 skills - Math, comparison, boolean, string

### 🟡 MINIMALLY COVERED (2 skills)
- **Motion**: 1 skill (T01.G3.01 teaches "move 10 steps, turn 90 degrees")
- **Sensing**: 1 skill (T07.G3.01 uses "touching" condition)

### 🔴 NOT COVERED (0 skills)
- **Looks**: No explicit costume/size/effects skills
- **Sound**: No foundational play/volume skills
- **Pen**: No drawing block skills

---

## Critical Skill: T01.G3.01

**Title:** Create a simple algorithm in code (sequence and events)

**What it teaches:**
- "move 10 steps"
- "turn 90 degrees"
- "say 'Done!'"

**Status:** This ONE skill is currently the entire foundation for teaching CreatiCode blocks.

## The Gap (23-29 New Skills Needed)

### Grade 2 Recommendations (6-8 skills)
1. Move and Turn - Basic motion
2. Say and Think - Speech bubbles
3. Play Sound - Basic audio
4. Switch Costume - Change appearance
5. Show/Hide - Visibility
6. Change Size - Scaling
7. Click Detection - Mouse sensing
8. Key Detection - Keyboard sensing

### Grade 3 Recommendations (9-12 skills)
1. Glide Motion - Smooth movement
2. Go To Position - Coordinate control
3. Point Direction - Rotation control
4. X/Y Position - Coordinate manipulation
5. Graphic Effects - Color, ghost, etc.
6. Sound Controls - Volume, tempo
7. Ask and Answer - User input
8. Distance Sensing - Proximity detection
9. Pen Drawing - Optional
10. Stamp - Optional
11. Random Numbers - Randomness
12. Math Functions - Round, abs, etc.

### Grade 3 Additions (if pen is priority)
- Pen Up/Down
- Stamp
- Clear
- Pen Color/Size

## Comparison: Concepts vs. Blocks

| What | Concept Skills | Block Skills | Ratio |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **Grade 3** | 78 | 2 | 39:1 |
| **Grade 4** | 26 | 0 | ∞:1 |
| **Grade 5** | 27 | 0 | ∞:1 |

**Interpretation:** For every 1 block tutorial skill, there are 39 concept skills.

## Student Capability After Grade 3

### ✅ CAN DO:
1. Create event-driven programs (when clicked, broadcasts)
2. Use all loop types (repeat, forever, repeat-until, nested)
3. Write conditionals (if/else, AND/OR/NOT)
4. Create and use variables (number, text, boolean)
5. Work with lists (create, iterate, search, sort)
6. Define custom functions (parameters, returns)
7. Use operators (math, comparison, boolean)

### ⚠️ MIGHT NOT KNOW:
1. How to glide smoothly
2. How to change costumes programmatically
3. How to control sound volume
4. How to detect specific keys
5. How to use mouse position
6. How to draw with the pen
7. Many motion/looks/sound/sensing blocks

## Recommendation

**Add 15-20 foundational block skills to Grades 2-3**

**Option A:** Create new topic "T37: CreatiCode Block Basics"
- 6-8 skills in Grade 2
- 9-12 skills in Grade 3
- Make these prerequisites for T14-T20 project topics

**Option B:** Expand T01 (Algorithms)
- Enhance T01.G3.01 to be a multi-skill sequence
- Add block tutorials as T01.G2.01-08, T01.G3.05-16
- Keep T01 as the "getting started with blocks" topic

**Why it matters:**
- Students need explicit block instruction before complex projects
- Current gap assumes students learn blocks through osmosis
- Foundational skills prevent frustration in project-based learning
