## Grade K (PreK–K)

Computing and technology in young students' lives are explored through concrete, everyday observations about how devices help and how they affect behavior.

### T35.GK.01 – Spot ways a computer helps people

- **Short name:** How does the computer help?
- **Description:** Students observe and identify ways that computing devices or apps help people at home, school, or in daily activities (e.g., video calls with family, music apps, drawing tools). They distinguish helping uses from other uses.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, picture-matching. Show images of people using devices (video call, playing a game, watching video, doing homework). Students drag or match each image to "helpful" or "not helpful" labels, or select the picture showing a helpful use of technology. Auto‑grading checks matches.

### T35.GK.02 – Recognize screen time and tiredness

- **Short name:** Playing too much makes you tired
- **Description:** Students understand that spending a long time looking at a screen can make them tired, and that balance (playtime, outside time, sleep) is important for feeling good.
- **Challenge format:** Concept, interactive story. A CreatiCode project shows a character using a device, playing outside, eating, and sleeping. Students are asked "What should the character do to feel better?" or "Is it good to play on the tablet all day?" with yes/no or multiple-choice options. Auto‑grading checks the answer.
