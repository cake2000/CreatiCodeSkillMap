3. REPLACEMENT STRATEGY:
   For each removed G3-or-lower dependency, ask:
   a) Is this truly foundational? → Remove entirely (assumed knowledge)
   b) Does it need a prerequisite? → Add the G4 or G5 equivalent
   c) Is it cross-topic context? → Keep ONLY if it's G4-G6

================================================================================
VALIDATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

After applying fixes, verify:

1. ✓ No G6 skill depends on GK, G1, G2, or G3 skills
2. ✓ All dependencies are from G4, G5, or G6
3. ✓ Cross-topic dependencies are still appropriate
4. ✓ Skills still have a clear learning progression
5. ✓ No skill becomes "orphaned" (unreachable from earlier grades)
6. ✓ Dependency chains are still logically sound

================================================================================
ESTIMATED EFFORT
================================================================================

Total skills to fix: 166 G6 skills
Total dependencies to remove: ~584 (approximately 3-4 per skill)

Automated approach:
- Create script to parse allskills.md
- Identify all G6 skills
- For each dependency, check grade level
- Remove if grade ≤ 3
- Optionally suggest G4/G5 replacements based on topic patterns

Manual review needed for:
- Ensuring replacement dependencies are appropriate
- Checking for unintended consequences
- Validating learning progressions

Time estimate:
- Automated cleanup: 1-2 hours
- Manual review: 4-6 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-3 hours
Total: 1-2 days of focused work
