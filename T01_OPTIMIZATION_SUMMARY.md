# T01 OPTIMIZATION PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Generated**: 2025-11-22
**Full Plan**: `/media/binyu/USB2/dev/CreatiCodeSkillMap/T01_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`

---

## OVERVIEW

Analyzed all 97 T01 (Everyday Algorithms) skills and identified **42 optimization opportunities** across three priority levels.

### Key Findings
- **67 of 97 skills** (69%) have quality issues or improvement opportunities
- **15 HIGH priority** issues require immediate attention
- **18 MEDIUM priority** issues should be addressed in Phase 1
- **9 LOW priority** issues are nice-to-have improvements

### Skill Count Impact
- **Current**: 97 skills
- **After optimization**: 98 skills (94 main + 4 sub-skills from T01.G8.10 split)
- **Net change**: +1 skill (consolidations + additions balanced)

---

## TOP 5 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. T01.G8.10 - Capstone Skill with 288 Dependencies
**Problem**: Single skill has 288 dependencies across 4 topics - too broad
**Solution**: Split into 4 sub-skills focused on algorithmic thinking
**Impact**: Better assessability, clearer scope

### 2. G3 Transition Cliff (0% → 100% External Dependencies)
**Problem**: G1-G2 are picture-based with no external deps; G3 jumps to 100% external deps
**Solution**: Add 2 bridging skills in late G2 (T01.G2.16, T01.G2.17) to prepare for code
**Impact**: Smoother transition, better student readiness

### 3. Redundant "Trace" Skills Across Grades
**Problem**: 9 skills ask to "trace algorithms" without clear differentiation
**Solution**: Add specific complexity criteria to each (step counts, nesting levels)
**Impact**: Clearer progression, better assessment

### 4. Duplicate Skills - T01.G1.02 and T01.G1.07
**Problem**: Both skills ask "do two algorithms end at same place?" - identical
**Solution**: Merge into T01.G1.02, delete T01.G1.07
**Impact**: Reduces G1 from 10 to 9 skills, eliminates redundancy

### 5. Missing "Repeat Until" vs "Repeat N" Concept
**Problem**: Skills teach counted loops but never address conditional loops
**Solution**: Add T01.G4.13 comparing both loop types
**Impact**: Fills conceptual gap

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1A: Safe Changes (No External Coordination)
**Timeline**: Start immediately
**Risk**: LOW
- Merge duplicate skills (H5, M4, M11, M13)
- Fix internal dependencies (H4, H12)
- Enhance descriptions (H3, H7, H13)
- Standardize terminology (M1)
- All LOW priority issues (L1-L9)

**Deliverable**: 42 of 42 issues addressed at description/internal level

### Phase 1B: External Dependency Changes
**Timeline**: After coordination with T06, T07, T08, T09 owners
**Risk**: MEDIUM
- Add bridging skills (H2, H10)
- Replace external dependencies (H9, H11, H15, M15, M16)
- Add new skills with external deps (M6, M17)
- Renumber skills (H8)

**Deliverable**: All dependency issues resolved

### Phase 1C: Complex Changes
**Timeline**: After 1A and 1B complete
**Risk**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Split T01.G8.10 (H1)
- Add new conceptual skills (H6, H14, M9)
- Test progression thoroughly

**Deliverable**: All structural changes complete

## DEPENDENCY IMPACT

### External Dependencies
- **Removed**: 8 inappropriate or redundant external dependencies
- **Added**: 5 necessary external dependencies for new skills
- **Preserved**: 3,357 existing external dependencies (ALL critical deps intact)
- **Critical deps preserved**: T06.G3.01 (43×), T09.G3.01.04 (40×), T07.G3.01 (34×), T08.G3.01 (28×)

### Internal Dependencies
- **Added**: 12 new internal T01 dependencies (better progression)
- **Modified**: 6 internal dependencies (clearer relationships)

## SUCCESS METRICS

After implementation, T01 should have:
- ✅ Clear progression from picture-based (K-2) to code-based (G3+)
- ✅ No duplicate or overlapping skills
- ✅ Smooth transitions between grade levels
- ✅ Appropriate scaffolding for complex concepts
- ✅ All external dependencies preserved
- ✅ Better assessability (specific, measurable objectives)
- ✅ Age-appropriate content at all levels

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Low Risk (87% of issues)
- 37 issues are description improvements, merges, or internal changes
- Can be implemented without coordination

### Medium Risk (10% of issues)
- 4 issues involve external dependency changes
- Requires coordination with other topic owners

### High Risk (3% of issues)
- 1 issue (T01.G8.10 split) affects 288 dependencies
- Requires careful planning and validation

**Overall Risk**: LOW to MEDIUM (most changes are low-impact)
