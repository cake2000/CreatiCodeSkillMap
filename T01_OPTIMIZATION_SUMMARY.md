# Topic T01 (Everyday Algorithms) - Optimization Summary

## Overview
Topic T01 (Everyday Algorithms) has been optimized to bridge the gap between "everyday" concepts and "CreatiCode" implementation, specifically strengthening the connection between abstract algorithm thinking and concrete platform features.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Skills Added
*   **T01.G3.27 - Manually execute a script's steps with a sprite (step-through):** A critical physical/visual bridge skill where students "act out" code before running it, reinforcing tracing concepts in a tangible way.
*   **T01.G5.31 - Replace manual logic with optimized built-in blocks:** Teaches "platform-aware" optimization (e.g., using `list contains item` instead of a manual loop), linking generic algorithms to efficient CreatiCode usage.
*   **T01.G8.26 - Refine an algorithm through iterative AI prompting:** Adds a modern "human-AI loop" skill, distinct from single-prompt generation, teaching students to guide AI through iterative refinement.

### 2. Skill Refinements
*   **T01.G6.16 (Recommendation Algorithms):** Changed verb from "Understand" to "Deconstruct and Analyze" to ensure active student engagement.
*   **T01.G5.01 & T01.G5.20 (Documentation):** added specific implementation notes to use CreatiCode's "Note" feature and "Comment Blocks", making the abstract task of documentation concrete within the IDE.

### 3. Quality Improvements
*   **Granularity:** Broken down the leap from "tracing" to "writing" with intermediate "acting out" and "optimizing" steps.
*   **Platform Integration:** Explicitly referenced CreatiCode features (XO, Notes, Comment Blocks, specialized blocks) in Implementation Notes to guide auto-grader and content developers.

## Coherence & Dependencies
All new skills follow the X-2 dependency rule and fit logically into the K-8 progression:
*   G3 tracing builds on G2 picture tracing.
*   G5 optimization builds on G4 refactoring.
*   G8 iterative prompting builds on G6/G7 AI verification and evaluation.
