## Summary

**Total Skills**: 35
**Granularity**: ✓ All appropriately sized

**Critical Issue Found**: **SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP with T07 (Loops) and T11 (Functions)**

### Duplicate/Overlapping Skills:
1. **T04.G1.01** ≈ T07.G1.01 (Spot repeated blocks)
2. **T04.G1.04** = T07.G1.04 (Repeat by copying blocks)
3. **T04.G2.02** = T07.G2.01 (Replace with loop)
4. **T04.G3.02** ≈ T07.G3.03 (Nested loops)
5. **T04.G3.03** should reference T11.G3.01 (Custom blocks)
6. **T04.G3.04** ≈ T07.G3.04 (Trace nested)
7. **T04.G4.02** should reference T11.G4.01 (Parameterized blocks)

**Recommendation**: T04 should focus on **pattern recognition and design thinking**, while delegating **implementation** to T07 (loops) and T11 (functions). Many T04 skills should add dependencies to T07/T11 rather than duplicate them.

**Grade-Level Dependency Issues**:
1. **T04.G6.01** depends on T01.G7.01 (Grade 7) - Move to G7 or change dependency

**Age-Appropriateness**: ✓ Good progression
- K-2: Visual patterns, concrete
- 3-5: Code patterns, abstraction beginning
- 6-8: Algorithm patterns, design thinking

**Cross-Topic Dependencies**:
- **T01 (Algorithms)**: Pattern recognition in algorithms
- **T02 (Representing)**: Visualizing patterns
- **T03 (Decomposition)**: Breaking patterns into parts
- **T06 (Events)**: Code execution context
- **T07 (Loops)**: PRIMARY OVERLAP - implementing repetition
- **T09 (Variables)**: Patterns in data
- **T10 (Lists)**: Data patterns
- **T11 (Functions)**: PRIMARY OVERLAP - code reuse via custom blocks
- **T12 (Program Organization)**: Code structure patterns
- **T14 (Games)**: Game patterns

**Recommendation for Topic Refinement**:
T04 should be refocused as "Pattern Recognition & Design Thinking" rather than duplicating implementation skills from T07 and T11. Keep the conceptual/analytical skills, reference the implementation skills.
