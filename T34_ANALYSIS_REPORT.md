## Issue Analysis

### HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

#### H1: X-2 Rule Violations (Grade Gap Too Large)

**Issue**: Several skills depend on skills from more than 2 grades earlier, violating the X-2 scaffolding rule.

**Violations Found:**

1. **T34.G2.03** (Grade 2) depends on **T34.GK.03** (Grade K)
   - Gap: 2 grades (K→2) - **BORDERLINE** but technically acceptable (K=0, 2=2, gap=2)
   - However, this is at the limit and worth noting

**Status**: Upon review, all dependencies actually comply with X-2 rule. No violations found.

---

#### H2: Forward Reference in Dependency

**Issue**: T34.G4.03 has a subtle forward-reference issue in its dependency structure.

**Violation:**
- **T34.G4.03** depends on **T34.G4.01** (same grade - OK)
- BUT it also depends on **T34.G3.03**, creating a path: G3.03 → G4.03
- Meanwhile **T34.G4.01** depends on **T34.G3.01** and **T34.G3.02**
- This creates potential parallel path confusion where G4.03 doesn't require G4.01's prerequisites

**Recommendation**: This is actually not a forward reference - it's properly structured. The skill can depend on any G3 skills since they're from a prior grade. **NO ACTION NEEDED**.

---

#### H3: Cross-Topic Dependency from Grade K to Grade 1

**Issue**: T34.G2.02 and T34.G2.03 depend on T01.G1.01, T01.G1.10, and T03.G1.03, which are Grade 1 skills.

**Details:**
- **T34.G2.02** (Grade 2) → T01.G1.10 (Grade 1) - VALID
- **T34.G2.02** (Grade 2) → T03.G1.03 (Grade 1) - VALID
- **T34.G2.03** (Grade 2) → T01.G1.01 (Grade 1) - VALID
- **T34.G2.01** (Grade 2) → T01.G1.01 (Grade 1) - VALID

**Status**: All cross-topic dependencies are properly structured (Grade 2 depending on Grade 1). **NO ISSUES**.

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

#### M1: Overly Broad Skill Descriptions

**Issue**: Some skills have descriptions that are too broad or could be more actionable.

**Skills Needing Improvement:**

1. **T34.G1.03**: "Explain that technology choices shape games/apps"
   - Current: "Learners state that creators pick characters, rules, and visuals, highlighting human design decisions."
   - **Problem**: Somewhat vague - what specific activity? How do they demonstrate understanding?
   - **Recommendation**: Add specific examples or deliverable: "Learners examine 2-3 simple games/apps and identify specific design choices (character selection, color scheme, sound effects), then explain one choice they would make differently and why."

2. **T34.G2.02**: "Identify communities impacted by inventions"
   - Current: "Learners analyze a case (screen readers, online maps) and list groups that gained access."
   - **Problem**: The deliverable is clear (list groups) but could be more specific about how students demonstrate understanding
   - **Recommendation**: Consider: "Learners analyze a case study (screen readers, online maps, or captioning) and create a simple chart showing: (1) what problem existed, (2) which communities were affected, (3) how the invention helped."

3. **T34.G5.01**: "Investigate social movements linked to computing"
   - Current: "Learners research how computing supported social causes (accessibility advocacy, community organizing, open-source movements) and analyze both historical movements and current initiatives."
   - **Problem**: Two separate activities (historical + current) might be too broad for one skill
   - **Recommendation**: Consider splitting into TWO skills:
     - T34.G5.01a: "Research historical social movements linked to computing (1960s-2000s)"
     - T34.G5.01b: "Connect historical movements to current digital activism"

4. **T34.G6.01**: "Analyze waves of computing (mainframe → mobile → AI)"
   - Current: "Students build comparison charts showing key characteristics (dominant hardware, typical users, limitations) for each computing era and make predictions about the next wave."
   - **Problem**: "Make predictions" is tacked on but is a complex separate skill
   - **Recommendation**: Split prediction into Grade 8 (already exists as T34.G8.01) or make predictions optional extension

---

#### M2: Potential Skill Complexity (Consider Splitting)

**Skills That Might Be Too Complex:**

1. **T34.G5.01**: "Investigate social movements linked to computing"
   - Covers both historical AND current initiatives
   - **Recommendation**: Consider split as noted in M1

2. **T34.G8.03**: "Produce primary-source research projects"
   - Multiple components: gather sources (oral histories, documents, photos), create multimedia presentation, connect to own projects
   - **Recommendation**: This is appropriate for Grade 8 capstone skill. KEEP AS IS but ensure it's positioned as a multi-week project.

**Status**: No immediate splits required, but T34.G5.01 is a candidate.

---

#### M3: Missing Explicit Connection to CreatiCode Platform

**Issue**: Most skills are appropriately platform-agnostic (computing history is universal), but some could better leverage CreatiCode for presentations/timelines.

**Skills That Could Reference CreatiCode:**

1. **T34.G7.03**: "Create presentations about computing pioneers"
   - Currently mentions "digital poster, slideshow, or simple CreatiCode scene"
   - **Status**: ✅ Already includes CreatiCode option - GOOD

2. **T34.G4.03**: "Link hardware evolution to modern software features"
   - Currently mentions "tools like CreatiCode (3D graphics, AI blocks)"
   - **Status**: ✅ Already references CreatiCode - GOOD

3. **T34.G3.01**: "Sequence milestones on a timeline"
   - Could mention creating interactive timelines in CreatiCode
   - **Recommendation**: Add optional extension: "Advanced: Create an interactive timeline in CreatiCode where clicking milestones shows details."

**Status**: Most skills appropriately balance platform-agnostic learning with optional CreatiCode integration. No critical issues.

---

### LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

#### L1: Minor Dependency Optimization Opportunities

**Issue**: Some skills have multiple dependencies from the same prior grade that might be redundant.

**Examples:**

1. **T34.G4.01**: Depends on both T34.G3.01 AND T34.G3.02
   - Both are Grade 3 skills
   - **Analysis**: Makes sense - needs timeline sequencing (G3.01) AND understanding of real-world impact (G3.02) to analyze cause/effect
   - **Recommendation**: KEEP AS IS

2. **T34.G5.01**: Depends on both T34.G4.01 AND T34.G4.02
   - Both are Grade 4 skills
   - **Analysis**: Makes sense - social movements require understanding both cause/effect (G4.01) and regional differences (G4.02)
   - **Recommendation**: KEEP AS IS

**Status**: Current dependencies are well-justified. No changes needed.

---

#### L2: Consistency in Skill Naming

**Issue**: Minor inconsistencies in verb choice and specificity.

**Observations:**

- Most skills use action verbs: "Spot," "Match," "Build," "Analyze," "Research," "Create"
- One skill uses "Learn from" which is less active: **T34.G6.03** - "Learn from historical computing failures"

**Recommendation**: Consider renaming to "Analyze historical computing failures and extract lessons" for consistency.

---

#### L3: Grade K Foundational Skills Could Be Stronger

**Issue**: Grade K skills are appropriate (picture-based, unplugged) but could create stronger foundation.

**Current K Skills:**
- GK.01: Spot computing tools
- GK.02: Match old vs new tech
- GK.03: Name person who uses computers

**Analysis**: These are good introductory skills but don't explicitly build toward "history" framing.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding a GK.04:
- **T34.GK.04**: "Sequence their own day using technology"
  - Students draw/place pictures showing morning→night and circle when they use technology
  - Builds foundational sequencing for later timeline work
  - Dependencies: T01.GK.01 (sequencing)

**Priority**: LOW - current skills are adequate, but this would strengthen scaffolding.

---

## Missing Skills Analysis

### Gap 1: Evolution of Programming Languages (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue**: Topic covers hardware evolution, social impact, and pioneers, but lacks explicit coverage of programming language evolution.

**Recommendation**: Add skill(s) in Grades 5-6:

**T34.G5.04**: "Trace the evolution of programming languages"
- Description: Students create a timeline showing major programming languages (machine code → assembly → FORTRAN → BASIC → modern languages like Python, JavaScript, Scratch) and explain why each was created (solving what problem).
- Dependencies: T34.G4.01 (cause/effect chains), T34.G4.03 (hardware evolution)
- **Rationale**: Programming languages are central to computing history and connect to students' own coding experiences

---

### Gap 2: Evolution of User Interfaces (LOW PRIORITY)

**Issue**: Hardware and software are covered, but UI/UX evolution is only implicit.

**Current Coverage:**
- T34.G4.03 mentions touchscreens as hardware
- But no explicit focus on command-line → GUI → touchscreen → voice interface evolution

**Recommendation**: Add skill in Grade 6:

**T34.G6.04**: "Analyze evolution of user interfaces"
- Description: Students research how people interacted with computers over time (punch cards → command line → mouse+GUI → touchscreen → voice/gesture) and explain how each change made computing more accessible.
- Dependencies: T34.G5.02 (cross-industry timelines), T34.G4.03 (hardware evolution)
- **Rationale**: UI evolution directly impacts accessibility and inclusion (connects to G6.02)

**Priority**: LOW - Could be integrated into existing skills rather than standalone

---

### Gap 3: Internet & Networking History (LOW PRIORITY)

**Issue**: Topics mention "internet" in examples but don't explicitly cover ARPANET → Internet → Web → Social Media evolution.

**Current Coverage:**
- Implicit in examples (T34.G3.02 mentions "internet → research")
- T34.G6.01 mentions computing waves

**Recommendation**: Consider whether this needs explicit skill or if current coverage is sufficient.

**Decision**: Current coverage is ADEQUATE. Networking history is covered in T31 (Networks & Internet). T34 appropriately focuses on computing broadly.

---

### Gap 4: Data Storage Evolution (LOW PRIORITY)

**Issue**: No explicit coverage of punch cards → magnetic tape → floppy disk → hard drive → SSD → cloud storage.

**Recommendation**: Add to T34.G4.03 description or keep as optional teacher extension.

**Priority**: LOW - Less critical than programming language evolution

---

## Cross-Topic Dependencies Summary

**All Cross-Topic Dependencies (to topics OTHER than T34):**

| T34 Skill | Depends On | Topic | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------|-------------|
| T34.G2.01 | T01.G1.01 | Sequencing | Put pictures in order to plant a seed |
| T34.G2.02 | T01.G1.10 | Conditionals | Match pictures to "if/then" rules |
| T34.G2.02 | T03.G1.03 | Decomposition | List steps for a simple classroom routine |
| T34.G2.03 | T01.G1.01 | Sequencing | Put pictures in order to plant a seed |

**Total Cross-Topic Dependencies**: 4 (to T01 and T03)

**Analysis**: All cross-topic dependencies are to foundational computational thinking skills (sequencing, conditionals, decomposition). These are appropriate and should be **PRESERVED** for Phase 2.

**No issues found** with cross-topic dependencies.

## Phase 1 Action Items

### Immediate (Must Do)

**None** - No critical issues found.

---

### Short-Term (Should Do)

1. **Update 5 skill descriptions**:
   ```
   T34.G1.03: Add specific examples and deliverable structure
   T34.G2.02: Add chart structure (problem, communities, solution)
   T34.G5.01: Clarify scope OR split into G5.01a/b
   T34.G6.01: Remove prediction component (redundant with G8.01)
   T34.G6.03: Change "Learn from" to "Analyze"
   ```

2. **Add new skill for programming language evolution**:
   ```
   T34.G5.04: Trace the evolution of programming languages
   - Timeline: machine code → assembly → high-level languages
   - Connect to students' own coding experiences
   - Dependencies: T34.G4.01, T34.G4.03
   ```

### Long-Term (Nice to Have)

1. **Consider adding**:
   - T34.GK.04: Technology sequencing activity (strengthen K foundation)
   - T34.G6.04: UI evolution analysis (or integrate into existing skill)

2. **Monitor in Phase 2**:
   - Cross-topic dependencies to T01, T03 (currently good, preserve)
   - CreatiCode integration opportunities for future platform updates

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment**: Topic T34 (Computing History) is **HIGH QUALITY** with:
- Clear, age-appropriate progression K→8
- Strong diversity and inclusion focus
- Good balance of knowledge acquisition and creation activities
- Clean dependency structure with no major violations
- Appropriate integration of CreatiCode as optional presentation tool

**Main Gaps**:
1. Programming language evolution (MEDIUM priority gap)
2. 5 skill descriptions need improvement (MEDIUM priority)
3. UI evolution could be more explicit (LOW priority)

**Strengths**:
- Excellent scaffolding and dependencies
- Strong social justice and diversity lens
- Real-world connections (interviews, modern relevance)
- Critical thinking skills (analyzing failures, forecasting)

**Phase 1 Recommendation**: Make 5 description improvements and add 1 new skill (T34.G5.04 on programming languages). Then T34 will be in excellent shape.
