Description: Students use the `change item (position) of [list] by (amount)` block to modify numeric values in a list arithmetically (e.g., increase a player's score by 10, decrease health by 5). They understand this changes the value without needing to manually get-calculate-replace, making score updates and counters much simpler. For young learners who don't know negative numbers, the `reduce item (position) of [list] by (amount)` block provides a simpler way to decrease values.

Dependencies:
* T10.G3.02: Read items from a list by position (index starts at 1)

## GRADE 5 (21 skills)

ID: T10.G5.01
Topic: T10 – Lists & Tables
Skill: Understand table structure (rows, columns, cells)
Description: Students identify and label the parts of a table: rows (horizontal, numbered), columns (vertical, named), and cells (values at row-column intersections). Given a sample table, they state the number of rows and columns, identify the value at a specific row-column intersection, and explain that each row represents one record while each column represents one attribute. Students understand that a table is like having multiple parallel lists (one list per column) organized together, where all lists have the same length and items at the same position are related. A table makes it easier to manage related data than using many separate parallel lists.
