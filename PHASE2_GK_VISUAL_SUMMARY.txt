REMOVE (If truly redundant):
  ? Remove T24.GK.03 → T24.GK.01 (has path via T24.GK.02)
  ? Remove T29.GK.03 → T29.GK.01 (has path via T29.GK.02)
  ? Keep T02.GK.04 → T02.GK.02 (may be pedagogically valuable)

REVIEW:
  ? 7 within-topic gaps (see full report)

================================================================================
BEFORE & AFTER COMPARISON
================================================================================

BEFORE Phase 2:
- Cross-topic patterns: 14 dependency flows
- Topics acting as hubs: T01 (primary), T04 (secondary)
- Gaps: Games & Data skills missing conceptual foundations

AFTER Phase 2:
- Cross-topic patterns: 17 dependency flows (+3)
- Topics acting as hubs: T01 (primary), T04, T06, T09, T10 (secondary)
- Improvement: Games connected to Events & Variables
- Improvement: Data connected to Variables & Lists
- Result: Stronger conceptual coherence

Overall Grade: A → A+ (with Phase 2 improvements)

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. T01 (Everyday Algorithms) is the KEYSTONE
   - 12 cross-topic dependencies connect to it
   - Properly serves as foundation for entire curriculum
   - Keep it strong!

2. Games & Data need conceptual bridges
   - Games need Events (T06) and Variables (T09)
   - Data needs Variables (T09) and Lists (T10)
   - Phase 2 adds these critical connections

3. Pattern recognition is well-integrated
   - T04 → T20 connection is exemplary
   - Shows how abstract patterns apply to creative work

4. Kindergarten complexity is appropriate
   - Max 2 direct dependencies per skill
   - Max depth 4 (very shallow)
   - Heavy use of visual/concrete tasks

5. Minor enhancements, not major fixes
   - Only 6-9 changes needed across 97 skills
   - Indicates good initial design
   - Changes are refinements, not corrections

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

DO:
  ✓ Add the 6 recommended dependencies
  ✓ Review and likely remove 2 transitive redundancies
  ✓ Review within-topic gaps case-by-case
  ✓ Keep T01 strong as foundation
  ✓ Maintain kindergarten-appropriate complexity

DON'T:
  ✗ Remove dependencies without careful consideration
  ✗ Add dependencies that skip necessary foundations
  ✗ Change skill IDs
  ✗ Add complex multi-step dependency chains
  ✗ Make kindergarten skills depend on higher grades

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Apply high priority fixes (3 additions)
  2. Apply medium priority fixes (3 additions)
  3. Review and clean up redundancies (2 removals)
  4. Consider within-topic gaps if time permits
  5. Validate changes don't introduce issues
