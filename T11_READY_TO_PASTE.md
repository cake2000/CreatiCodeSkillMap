## What Was Done

### 1. Added 3 Critical Scaffolding Skills

**T11.G5.02.5** - Match parameter names to argument values
- Bridges the gap between single and multiple parameters
- Ensures students understand positional matching

**T11.G5.05.5** - Decide command vs reporter block type
- Explicit practice making design decisions
- Prevents confusion about when to use each type

**T11.G6.02.5** - Test with boundary and edge cases
- Fills testing gap between creation and evaluation
- Teaches systematic testing practices

### 2. Fixed 5 Dependency Issues

- **G4.04** & **G4.05**: Now require basic custom block skills (G4.01, G4.02)
- **G5.02**: Changed from G4.05 to G4.06 (more logical prerequisite)
- **G5.05**: Now requires G5.02 (single parameter before multiple)
- **G5.08**: Now requires both G5.02 and G5.06 (both block types)

### 3. Scoped Down 2 Overly Broad Skills

- **G7.01**: ONE algorithm instead of multiple (depth over breadth)
- **G8.01**: 3-5 blocks in one project instead of library + two projects

### 4. Improved Clarity in 4 Skills

- **G3.03**: Clarified as analysis of existing code (vs design in G5.01)
- **G4.03**: Added forward reference to custom reporters
- **G5.04**: Specified focus on major components with diagram
- **G6.04**: Added explicit design criteria and example problems

## Files Created

1. **T11_PHASE1_OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETE.md** - Comprehensive change log
2. **T11_SKILL_INDEX.md** - Quick reference guide by grade
3. **T11_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Complete verification
4. **T11_READY_TO_PASTE.md** - This summary (for easy reference)

## Key Improvements

### Learning Progressions Now Crystal Clear

**Parameter Mastery Path:**
G3.02 → G4.06 → G5.02 → **G5.02.5** → G5.05

**Block Type Understanding:**
G3.04 → G4.02 → G4.03 → **G5.05.5** → G5.06

**Testing & Debugging:**
G5.07 → **G6.02.5** → G6.04 → G7.04

### No More Gaps

- ✅ Students won't jump from 1 parameter to 2+ without practice matching
- ✅ Students won't create reporters without deciding when to use them
- ✅ Students won't evaluate blocks without learning to test them first

### More Achievable Goals

- ✅ Implement ONE algorithm well instead of many superficially
- ✅ Build 3-5 reusable blocks instead of entire library + projects

## Verification

All changes verified through:
- ✅ Line count checks (319 → 355 lines, +36 as expected)
- ✅ Skill ID verification (all 33 skills present and correctly ordered)
- ✅ Dependency validation (all internal T11 refs point to valid skills)
- ✅ External dependency preservation (T01-T10, T12-T36 unchanged)
- ✅ Format consistency (ID, Topic, Skill, Description, Dependencies)
- ✅ Content spot-checks (new skills, modified descriptions, dependencies)

## Result

T11 is now a **pedagogically sound, well-scaffolded progression** from Grade 3 conceptual understanding through Grade 8 mastery of functions and procedures.

**Phase 1 optimization: COMPLETE ✅**
