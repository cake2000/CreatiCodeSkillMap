## 2. ISSUES FOUND (Current State After Phase 1)

### High Priority Issues: 0 REMAINING
All high priority issues (dependency errors, unclear references) were fixed in Phase 1.

### Medium Priority Issues: POTENTIAL CONCERNS FOR PHASE 2

#### M1: Heavy Reliance on T05.G1.01 and T05.G1.02
**Issue:** Skills T05.G1.01 and T05.G1.02 are referenced by 23+ and 21+ skills respectively across multiple grades (G6-G8). This creates:
- High dependency concentration on Grade 1 skills
- Potential bottleneck in skill progression
- Long-range dependencies (G8 skills depending on G1 skills)

**Skills Affected:** T05.G6.01, G6.02, G6.03, G6.04, G6.06 (all Grade 6); all Grade 7 and 8 skills that were updated

**Impact:** While technically within X-2 range for some grades, this pattern suggests these G1 skills might be acting as "foundational concepts" that should potentially be:
1. Broken into grade-appropriate versions
2. Replaced with intermediate grade skills
3. Reconsidered as essential prerequisites

**Recommendation:** Phase 2 should review whether G6+ skills truly need G1 skills or if they should depend on more advanced intermediate skills (G4-G5).

---

#### M2: Cross-Topic Dependency on T08.G3.01/02/03 (Conditionals)
**Issue:** Several G3 HCD skills depend on conditional logic skills from T08:
- T05.G3.01 → T08.G3.01 (Use a simple if)
- T05.G3.03 → T08.G3.02 (Decide when single if is enough)
- T05.G3.05 → T08.G3.03 (Pick right conditional block)

**Concern:** These dependencies assume students learn conditionals (T08) before or alongside HCD concepts. Need to verify:
1. Is this sequence realistic in curriculum?
2. Are conditionals truly necessary for these HCD planning skills?
3. Should these be optional/alternative dependencies?

**Recommendation:** Phase 2 should verify the necessity of these T08 dependencies and confirm they align with typical curriculum sequences.

---

#### M3: Cross-Topic Dependency on T09.G3.01 (Variables)
**Issue:** Simulation planning skills depend on variables:
- T05.G3.04 → T09.G3.01
- T05.G5.03 → T09.G3.01
- T05.G5.04 → T09.G3.01
- T05.G6.05 → T09.G3.01

**Concern:** Variables are essential for simulation planning, but this creates a hard dependency on T09 completion before simulation planning can begin.

**Recommendation:** This seems appropriate but should be verified in Phase 2 to ensure T09 is typically taught before or alongside simulation topics.

---

#### M4: Cross-Topic Dependencies on T01 (Algorithms)
**Issue:** Several skills depend on T01 algorithm skills:
- T05.G5.03 → T01.G3.01 (Complete script with missing blocks)
- T05.G6.05 → T01.G3.01
- T05.G8.03 → T01.G6.01 (Count comparisons in search)
- T05.G8.05 → T01.G6.01
- T05.G8.06 → T01.G6.01

**Concern:** The dependency on T01.G6.01 (comparing search algorithms) for G8 HCD/simulation skills seems tangential. Why is algorithm efficiency needed for design briefs?

**Recommendation:** Phase 2 should verify these T01 dependencies are truly necessary or if they should be replaced with more relevant prerequisites.

---

#### M5: Isolated Cross-Topic Dependencies
**Issue:** Single instances of dependencies on:
- T05.G3.03 → T07.G3.01 (Use a counted repeat loop)
- T05.G5.05 → T04.G3.01 (Identify where loop could replace repeated blocks)
- T05.G7.03 → T06.G5.01 (Build green-flag script)

**Concern:** These appear to be reasonable prerequisites but should be verified for necessity.

**Recommendation:** Phase 2 review for appropriateness.

---

### Low Priority Issues: MINOR OBSERVATIONS

#### L1: Simulation Skills Could Form Sub-Topic
**Observation:** Skills related to simulation planning form a coherent sub-strand:
- G2: T05.G2.03, T05.G2.04 (recognize simulations, choose elements)
- G3: T05.G3.04, T05.G3.05 (what to show, rules)
- G4: T05.G4.05, T05.G4.06 (simplification decisions)
- G5: T05.G5.03, T05.G5.04, T05.G5.06 (variables, rules, measurements)
- G6: T05.G6.05, T05.G6.06 (plan simulation, justify choices)
- G8: T05.G8.03, T05.G8.04 (controlled experiments, interpret results)

**Consideration:** Could create T05-A (HCD) and T05-B (Simulation Planning) as distinct sub-topics.

**Recommendation:** Consider in Phase 2 whether this split would improve clarity or create unnecessary complexity.

---

#### L2: Grade 7 Skills All Have Same Dependencies
**Observation:** All six G7 skills share identical dependencies:
- T05.G5.01, T05.G5.02, T05.G5.05 (with T06.G5.01 added to G7.03)

**Impact:** This suggests strong cohesion in G7 strand but might indicate:
1. Missing intermediate stepping stones
2. All skills at same difficulty level
3. Potential for consolidation

**Recommendation:** Verify in Phase 2 if G7 skills truly need all three G5 dependencies or if some could be reduced.

---

#### L3: XO Integration in T05.G8.02
**Observation:** T05.G8.02 involves XO (AI assistant) for critique and refinement.

**Consideration:** This is the only skill that explicitly requires AI interaction in T05.

**Recommendation:** Ensure this aligns with AI4K12 priorities and that XO capabilities support this skill.

**Dependencies FROM Other Topics:**
None identified - T05 is not depended upon by other topics yet.

**Recommendations for Phase 2:**
1. **Preserve:** T01.GK.03, T03.GK.01, T06.G3.01, T06.G5.01, T09.G3.01
2. **Review for Necessity:** T01.G6.01 (algorithm efficiency for design briefs?), T04.G3.01 (loops for testing?), T07.G3.01 (loops for feedback?)
3. **Review T08 Dependencies:** Are conditionals truly necessary for HCD process ordering and simulation planning?

## 8. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Current State (Phase 1 Complete):

1. **ACCEPT Current State** ✓
   - All Phase 1 optimizations successfully applied
   - X-2 rule violations fixed
   - Dependency references corrected
   - Redundant dependencies removed
   - Topic structure is sound

### For Phase 2 (Cross-Topic Optimization):

#### High Priority Recommendations:

1. **Review Heavy G1 Dependencies in G6-G8**
   - **Issue:** G6, G7, G8 skills heavily depend on T05.G1.01 and T05.G1.02
   - **Action:** Determine if these G1 skills are truly "foundational concepts" or if intermediate grade skills should be used instead
   - **Options:**
     - Keep as-is if G1 skills are fundamental building blocks
     - Replace with intermediate skills (G4-G5) if progression allows
     - Create "reinforcement" versions at higher grades

2. **Verify T01.G6.01 Dependencies in G8**
   - **Issue:** T05.G8.03, G8.05, G8.06 depend on "Count comparisons in linear and binary search"
   - **Action:** Confirm why algorithm efficiency is needed for design briefs
   - **Options:**
     - Remove if not essential
     - Replace with more relevant T01 skill
     - Keep if there's valid reasoning (e.g., understanding tradeoffs)

3. **Review T08 (Conditionals) Dependencies in G3**
   - **Issue:** T05.G3.01 (HCD process ordering) depends on T08.G3.01 (simple if)
   - **Action:** Verify conditionals are necessary for understanding design process
   - **Options:**
     - Remove if HCD process can be taught without coding knowledge
     - Keep if CreatiCode implementation requires it
     - Make optional/alternative dependency

#### Medium Priority Recommendations:

4. **Verify T04.G3.01 and T07.G3.01 Dependencies**
   - **Issue:** Single isolated dependencies on patterns and loops
   - **Action:** Confirm necessity and appropriateness
   - **Options:** Keep, remove, or replace based on review

5. **Consider Simulation Sub-Topic Split**
   - **Issue:** Simulation skills form coherent sub-strand
   - **Action:** Evaluate if T05-A (HCD) and T05-B (Simulation Planning) would improve clarity
   - **Options:**
     - Keep unified (current state)
     - Split into sub-topics
     - Create cross-references

6. **Standardize G7 Dependencies**
   - **Issue:** All G7 skills have same three dependencies
   - **Action:** Verify if all skills truly need all three or if some can be reduced
   - **Impact:** Potential for cleaner progression or exposing missing steps

#### Low Priority Recommendations:

7. **Document XO Integration**
   - **Issue:** T05.G8.02 uses XO for critique
   - **Action:** Ensure XO capabilities support this skill and align with AI4K12
   - **Impact:** Verify AI integration is pedagogically sound

8. **Cross-Check with CreatiCode Implementation**
   - **Action:** Verify all skills are implementable in CreatiCode's auto-grading system
   - **Impact:** Ensure assessment formats are feasible
