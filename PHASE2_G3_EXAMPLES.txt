PHASE 2: Grade 3 Dependency Fixes - Examples

=================================================================
EXAMPLE 1: Invalid Dependency Fixed
=================================================================

Skill: T14.G3.06 - Switch to game mode
Topic: T14 (Games)

BEFORE:
Dependencies:
* T14.G3.05: Detect when sprite is clicked
* T10.G3.01: Loop through and process each item in a list   <-- INVALID (doesn't exist)

AFTER:
Dependencies:
* T14.G3.05: Detect when sprite is clicked
* T09.G3.01.01: Create a new variable with a descriptive name  <-- FIXED
* T07.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop                         <-- ADDED

Why: T10.G3.01 does not exist. Replaced with correct variable skill T09.G3.01.01

=================================================================
EXAMPLE 2: Cross-Topic Dependencies Added (Games)
=================================================================

Skill: T14.G3.02 - Keep sprite on screen
Topic: T14 (Games)

BEFORE:
Dependencies:
* T14.G3.01.02: Move sprite in 4 directions with arrow keys
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script

AFTER:
Dependencies:
* T14.G3.01.02: Move sprite in 4 directions with arrow keys
* T08.G3.01: Use a simple if in a script
* T09.G3.01.01: Create a new variable with a descriptive name  <-- ADDED

Why: Skill uses if-statements with x/y positions, requires variable understanding

=================================================================
EXAMPLE 3: Cross-Topic Dependencies Added (Data Viz)
=================================================================

Skill: T20.G3.01 - Create a simple bar chart
Topic: T20 (Data Visualization)

BEFORE:
Dependencies:
* T20.G2.01: Read and interpret a picture-based bar chart

AFTER:
Dependencies:
* T20.G2.01: Read and interpret a picture-based bar chart
* T08.G3.01: Use a counted repeat loop  <-- ADDED

Why: Creating charts requires looping through data points

=================================================================
EXAMPLE 4: Cross-Topic Dependencies Added (AI)
=================================================================

Skill: T25.G3.02.01 - Train a simple classifier with 2-3 categories
Topic: T25 (AI Concepts)

BEFORE:
Dependencies:
* T25.G3.01.01: Recognize that ML models learn from examples

AFTER:
Dependencies:
* T25.G3.01.01: Recognize that ML models learn from examples
* T09.G3.01.01: Create a new variable with a descriptive name  <-- ADDED
* T10.G3.01.01: Create a numeric variable                      <-- ADDED

Why: Training classifiers requires understanding variables for tracking data

=================================================================
EXAMPLE 5: Invalid Dependency Removed (No Replacement Needed)
=================================================================

Skill: T18.G3.03 - Initialize a 3D scene with a specific environment
Topic: T18 (Simulation)

BEFORE:
Dependencies:
* T18.G2.03: Create a basic 3D scene
* T09.G3.01: Create and use a numeric variable  <-- INVALID (doesn't exist)

AFTER:
Dependencies:
* T18.G2.03: Create a basic 3D scene

Why: T09.G3.01 doesn't exist, and this skill doesn't actually require variables
