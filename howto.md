we are aiming for "IXL for coding based on creaticode", and we need top quality result. No one has done this before in the world. It will be a unique contribution that will benefit all kids learning to code to have a systematic map of skills laid out to go from newbies to master programmers and engineers. CSTA has a standard but it is too vague and also missing important skill categories like AI and 3D and project development. This skill map will become the new golden standard for all coding platforms/educators to rely on.

there is no AGENTS.md. Just read 00-START-HERE.md and spec_v2_updated.md to understand the whole project, and read the key referneces like csta standard draft, and ai priorities, and creaticode introduction in the root folder. ignore ACSL since it is too theoretic!

latest version of skills are in "skillsv4" folder (ignore the other skills folders)

now, we need to enhance the quality of the skills for this version. read the file skillsv4/allskills.md, which contains all skills. The ID tells you the topic and grade level "G1" means grade 1.

Review all these skills as a whole, and provide your critical review and analysis on how these can be improved, including but not limited to: adding/removing skills, rewording, reordering, moving skills to earlier or later grades, etc.

Example questions to consider but not limited to:
* Is each skill age appropriate? especially not too abstract/complex for younger students
* Is a skill aligned well with standards?
* are we missing any skills?
* do skills progress in a scaffolded way? no jump or gap
* for each skill, do we also have all dependent skills in the earlier or same grade level?

generate an actionable list and save into (update) the file named "improvements.md" under that folder.





I need you to thoroughly review T01 to T05, and make suggestions on how to improve them, especially related to standard alignment, difficulty level that's suitable for the grade levels, ordering of skills.
