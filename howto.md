we are aiming for "IXL for coding based on creaticode", and we need top quality result.

there is no AGENTS.md. Just read spec_v2_updated.md to understand the whole project, and read the key referneces like csta standard draft, and ai priorities, and creaticode introduction. ignore ACSL since it is too theoretic!

latest skills and topic definitions are in "skillsv4" folder (ignore the other skills folders)

now, we need to enhance the quality of the skills for this version. read the file skillsv4/allskills.md, which contains all skills. The ID tells you the topic and grade level "G1" means grade 1.

Review all these skills as a whole, and provide your critical review and analysis on how these can be improved, including but not limited to: adding/removing skills, rewording, reordering, moving skills to earlier or later grades, etc.

Example questions to consider but not limited to:
* Is each skill age appropriate? especially not too abstract/complex for younger students
* Is a skill aligned well with standards?
* are we missing any skills?
* do skills progress in a scaffolded way? no jump or gap
* for each skill, do we also have all dependent skills in the earlier or same grade level?

generate an actionable list and save into a file named "improvements.md" under that folder.





I need you to thoroughly review T01 to T05, and make suggestions on how to improve them, especially related to standard alignment, difficulty level that's suitable for the grade levels, ordering of skills.
