read spec_v2_updated.md to understand the whole project, and read the key referneces like csta standard draft, and ai priorities, and creaticode introduction.

ignore ACSL since it is too theoretic!

latest skills and topic definitions are in "skillsv3" folder (ignore the "skills" folder)

we are aiming for "IXL for coding based on creaticode", and we need top quality result.

now, we need to enhance the quality of the skills. let's improve the topic of T14, and review ALL the skills in that one topic. so read and then update this file:

D:\dev\CreatiCodeSkillMap\skillsv3\skills_T14_games.md

read this file docs/TOPIC_IXL_MICROSTEP_GUIDE.md to learn how to do it. note that k-2 level skills will not touch code blocks yet. They start to do any coding or do scripts/blocks in grade 3. 

Also you need to check this topic against other topics, especially 1/2/3/4/5/12 to ensure no duplicates and skills progress well from grade to grades.

The key is scaffolding and ordering/sequencing logically. also always keep skill challenges engaging/fun.
