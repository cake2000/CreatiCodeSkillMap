### Challenges Addressed
1. **Outdated Extraction**: Original optimization plan was based on older file state
   - *Solution*: Adapted implementation to current file, focusing on applicable changes

   - *Solution*: Only added 6 skills (6% increase), all filling critical gaps

### Recommendations for Other Topics
1. Review all G2→G3 transitions (other topics may have similar cliffs)
2. Add specific complexity metrics to similar skills across grades
3. Audit external dependencies for appropriateness
4. Consider adding loop type comparison skills in other coding topics
