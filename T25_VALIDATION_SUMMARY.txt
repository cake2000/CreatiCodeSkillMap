T25 DATA REPRESENTATION - OPTIMIZATION VALIDATION SUMMARY
==========================================================

Analysis Date: 2025-11-21
Analyst: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
Scope: Intra-T25 issues only (cross-topic dependencies preserved)

CRITICAL FINDINGS
=================

1. PLATFORM ACCURACY ISSUE - CRITICAL
   Skill: T25.G7.03
   Problem: References JSON (NOT supported by CreatiCode)
   Current: "Create JSON-like snippets to store structured state"
   Impact: Students learn non-existent feature
   Fix: Rewrite to use cloud storage serialization
   Priority: IMMEDIATE

2. SKILL ID NUMBERING ISSUE
   Skill: T25.G3.04.01
   Problem: Non-standard numbering (.01 at Grade 3)
   Impact: Breaks numbering convention
   Fix: Renumber to T25.G3.05
   Priority: HIGH

3. MISSING CREATICODE FEATURES
   Problem: Core features not taught
   Missing:
   - Table operations (create, query, manipulate)
   - Cloud storage (persistence across sessions)
   - Google Sheets integration
   - AI vision table data processing
   Impact: Students can't use major platform features
   Fix: Add 5-7 new skills covering these features
   Priority: HIGH

X-2 RULE COMPLIANCE
===================
Status: PASSING ✓
No violations found within T25
All dependencies properly grade-sequenced

QUALITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED
==========================

1. Vague Descriptions (5 skills):
   - T25.G3.04 - Too much "explain", not enough "do"
   - T25.G4.01 - Poor dependencies (uses GK instead of G3)
   - T25.G5.01 - References tables before taught
   - T25.G6.03 - Too broad (should split)
   - T25.G8.01 - Too abstract (needs concrete guidance)

2. Missing Scaffolding:
   - Table skills: Concept exists but no implementation
   - Cloud storage: Mentioned but never taught how
   - Nested structures: Too complex for one skill

✓ Add cloud skill (G6.06)
✓ Revise T25.G5.01

PHASE 3 (Week 3) - MEDIUM:
✓ Add advanced skills (G7.05, G7.06)
✓ Revise remaining skills

PHASE 4 (Week 4) - POLISH:
✓ Optional enhancements
✓ Validation pass

ESTIMATED EFFORT
================

Total: 29 hours over 4 weeks
├─ Critical rewrites: 2 hours
├─ New skill development: 14 hours
├─ Revisions: 5 hours
├─ Dependency updates: 3 hours
├─ Validation: 4 hours
└─ Documentation: 1 hour

RISK ASSESSMENT
===============

High Risks:
- Breaking existing curricula (Mitigate: Test before deploy)
- Confusion from renumbering (Mitigate: Migration guide)

Medium Risks:
- Over-complicating Grade 5 (Mitigate: Strong scaffolding)

Low Risks:
- Missing CreatiCode features (Mitigate: Verify blocks exist)
- Scope creep (Mitigate: Stick to phases)

SUCCESS CRITERIA
================

✓ Platform Accuracy: 100% (no unsupported features)
✓ Feature Coverage: 100% (all core data features)
✓ ID Consistency: 100% (standard numbering)
✓ Assessability: 100% (concrete descriptions)
✓ X-2 Compliance: 100% (no violations)
✓ Grade-Appropriate: 100% (developmental fit)

CONCLUSION
==========

T25 Data Representation currently has ONE CRITICAL platform accuracy 
issue (JSON reference) and SEVERAL HIGH PRIORITY gaps (missing table/
cloud/sheets coverage). The topic is pedagogically sound but needs 
alignment with CreatiCode's actual capabilities.

Recommended Action: APPROVE Phase 1 critical fixes for immediate 
implementation, followed by phased rollout of new feature coverage.

Expected Outcome: Fully platform-aligned T25 with 100% CreatiCode 
feature coverage, clear progression, and concrete assessable skills.

APPROVAL STATUS

[ ] Reviewed by curriculum lead
[ ] Reviewed by technical lead
[ ] Approved for Phase 1 implementation
